If a company is willing to pay $100,000 for 2000 hours of part-time work, that equates to approximately $50 per hour. However, the actual pay would depend on competition, as if someone else is willing to work for less, say $30 per hour, they might get the job instead. The company is opting for part-time work instead of full-time to save costs, as they do not have 2000 hours of work."}

Legit: 100%   :) Edit:  Can you tell me that in my case what are the required fields on the invoice? If you're non-VAT registered, there are no legal requirements as to what information you need to put on the invoice -it literally can be a couple of numbers on a napkin, and still be legit.  With that said, to make a professional appearance, my invoices are usually structured as follows: Left side: ( Sidenote: why client-specific incremental numbering? Why, so they can't make educated guesses to the number of clients I have at any given time :)  ) Right side: Center table: And so far, none of my clients missed any fields, so this should have everything they need to :) Hope this helps, but keep in mind, all of the above is synthetic sugar on the top -ultimately,  the relationship you share with your Clients is the thing you will (or will not) get paid for!

{"pid": "169062", "metadata": {}, "title_text": "", "passage_text": "\"It's good to ask this question, because this is one of the fundamental dichotomies in market microstructure. At any time T for each product on a (typical) exchange there are two well-defined prices: At time T there is literally no person in the market who wants to sell below the ask, so all the people who are waiting to buy at the bid (or below) could very well be waiting there forever.  There's simply no guarantee that any seller will ever want to part with their product for a lesser price than they think it's worth. So if you want to buy the product at time T you have a tough choice to make: you get in line at the bid price, where there's no guarantee that your request will ever be filled, and you might never get your hands on the product you decide that owning the product right now is more valuable to you than (ask - bid) * quantity, so you tell the exchange that you're willing to buy at the ask price, and the exchange matches you with whichever seller is first in line Now, if you're in the market for the long term, the above choice is completely immaterial to you.  Who cares if you pay $10.00 * 1000 shares or $10.01 * 1000 shares when you plan to sell 30 years from now at $200 (or $200.01)? But if you're a day trader or anyone else with a very short time horizon, then this choice is extremely important: if the price is about to go up several cents and you got in line at the bid (and never got filled) then you missed out on some profit if you \"\"cross the spread\"\" to buy at the ask and then the price doesn't go up (or worse, goes down), you're screwed.  In order to get out of the position you'll have to cross the spread again and sell at at most the bid, meaning you've now paid the spread twice (plus transaction fees and regulatory fees) for nothing. (All of the above also applies in reverse for selling at the ask versus selling at the bid, but most people like to learn in terms of buying rather than selling.)\"", "summary_text": "The text discusses the fundamental dilemma in market microstructure, specifically focusing on the bid-ask spread. At any given time T, there are two prices: the bid (lowest price a buyer is willing to pay) and the ask (highest price a seller is willing to accept). If a buyer wants to purchase a product at time T, they have two options: wait in line at the bid price with no guarantee of fulfillment, or pay the ask price to be matched with the first seller in line.\n\nFor long-term investors, the difference between the bid and ask prices is insignificant as they plan to sell the product far in the future. However, for short-term traders, such as day traders, the choice is crucial. If the price is expected to rise and the trader waits at the bid but doesn't get filled, they miss out on potential profit. If they cross the spread to buy at the ask and the price doesn't increase (or decreases), they are left with a loss as they would have to sell at the bid, effectively paying the spread twice. This situation is applicable to both buying and selling, but the explanation is typically presented from a buying perspective."}
