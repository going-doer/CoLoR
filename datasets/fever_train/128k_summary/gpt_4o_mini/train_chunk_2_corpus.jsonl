Albanians produced many prominent figures such as Skanderbeg , leader of the medieval Albanian resistance to the Ottoman conquest and others during the Albanian National Awakening seeking self-determination . During the 17th and 18th century Albanians in large numbers converted to Islam , often to escape higher taxes levied on Christian subjects . As Muslims , some Albanians attained important political and military positions within the Ottoman Empire and culturally contributed to the wider Muslim world . Albania gained its independence in 1912 and between 1945 -- 1992 , Albanians lived under a repressive communist regime . Albanians within Yugoslavia underwent periods of discrimination and eventual self-determination that concluded with the breakup of that state in the early 1990s culminating with Albanians living in new countries and Kosovo .

According to Islamic doctrine , he was God 's Messenger ( ras\u016bl All\u0101h ) sent to confirm the essential teachings of monotheism preached previously by Adam , Abraham , Moses , Jesus , and other prophets . He is viewed as the final prophet of God in primary branches of Islam , though some modern denominations diverge from this belief.The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community considers Muhammad to be the `` Seal of the Prophets '' ( Kh\u0101tam an-Nabiyy\u012bn ) and the last law-bearing Prophet but not the last Prophet .

United Submitters International consider Rashad Khalifa to be a prophet . ( Source : Daniel Pipes , Miniatures : Views of Islamic and Middle Eastern Politics , p. 98 ( 2004 ) ) Muhammad united Arabia into a single Muslim polity and ensured that his teachings , practices , and the Quran , formed the basis of Islamic religious belief .   Born approximately 570CE ( Year of the Elephant ) in the Arabian city of Mecca , Muhammad was orphaned at an early age ; he was raised under the care of his paternal uncle Abu Talib . Periodically , he would seclude himself in a mountain cave named Hira for several nights of prayer ; later , at age 40 , he reported being visited by Gabriel in the cave , where he stated he received his first revelation from God . Three years later , in 610 , Muhammad started preaching these revelations publicly , proclaiming that `` God is One '' , that complete `` surrender '' ( lit . isl\u0101m ) to him is the right course of action ( d\u012bn ) , and that he was a prophet and messenger of God , similar to the other prophets in Islam .   Muhammad gained few early followers , and met hostility from some Meccan tribes . To escape persecution , Muhammad sent some followers to Abyssinia before he and his followers migrated from Mecca to Medina ( then known as Yathrib ) in the year 622 . This event , the Hijra , marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar , also known as the Hijri Calendar . In Medina , Muhammad united the tribes under the Constitution of Medina . In December 629 , after eight years of intermittent conflict with Meccan tribes , Muhammad gathered an army of 10,000 Muslim converts and marched on the city of Mecca . The attack went largely uncontested and Muhammad seized the city with little bloodshed . In 632 , a few months after returning from the Farewell Pilgrimage , he fell ill and died . Before his death , most of the Arabian Peninsula had converted to Islam .   The revelations ( each known as Ayah , lit . `` Sign -LSB- of God -RSB- '' ) , which Muhammad reported receiving until his death , form the verses of the Quran , regarded by Muslims as the `` Word of God '' and around which the religion is based .

Wilde 's parents were successful Anglo-Irish , Dublin intellectuals . Their son became fluent in French and German early in life . At university , Wilde read Greats ; he proved himself to be an outstanding classicist , first at Dublin , then at Oxford . He became known for his involvement in the rising philosophy of aestheticism , led by two of his tutors , Walter Pater and John Ruskin . After university , Wilde moved to London into fashionable cultural and social circles .   As a spokesman for aestheticism , he tried his hand at various literary activities : he published a book of poems , lectured in the United States and Canada on the new `` English Renaissance in Art '' , and then returned to London where he worked prolifically as a journalist . Known for his biting wit , flamboyant dress and glittering conversation , Wilde became one of the best-known personalities of his day .   At the turn of the 1890s , he refined his ideas about the supremacy of art in a series of dialogues and essays , and incorporated themes of decadence , duplicity , and beauty into his only novel , The Picture of Dorian Gray ( 1890 ) . The opportunity to construct aesthetic details precisely , and combine them with larger social themes , drew Wilde to write drama . He wrote Salome ( 1891 ) in French in Paris but it was refused a licence for England due to the absolute prohibition of Biblical subjects on the English stage . Unperturbed , Wilde produced four society comedies in the early 1890s , which made him one of the most successful playwrights of late Victorian London .

After two more trials he was convicted and imprisoned for two years ' hard labour , the maximum penalty .   In 1897 , in prison , he wrote De Profundis , which was published in 1905 , a long letter which discusses his spiritual journey through his trials , forming a dark counterpoint to his earlier philosophy of pleasure . Upon his release he left immediately for France , never to return to Ireland or Britain .

He is widely regarded as one of the most significant and celebrated sports figures of the 20th century . From early in his career , Ali was known as an inspiring , controversial , and polarizing figure both inside and outside the ring .   Cassius Clay was born and raised in Louisville , Kentucky , and began training as an amateur boxer when he was 12 years old . At age 18 , he won a gold medal in the light heavyweight division at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome and turned professional later that year . At age 22 in 1964 , he won the WBA , WBC , and lineal heavyweight titles from Sonny Liston in a big upset . Clay then converted to Islam and changed his name from Cassius Clay , which he called his `` slave name '' , to Muhammad Ali . He set an example of racial pride for African Americans and resistance to white domination during the Civil Rights Movement .   In 1966 , two years after winning the heavyweight title , Ali further antagonized the white establishment by refusing to be drafted into the U.S. military , citing his religious beliefs and opposition to American involvement in the Vietnam War . He was eventually arrested , found guilty of draft evasion charges , and stripped of his boxing titles . He successfully appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court , which overturned his conviction in 1971 , by which time he had not fought for nearly four years and thereby lost a period of peak performance as an athlete . Ali 's actions as a conscientious objector to the war made him an icon for the larger counterculture generation .   Ali is regarded as one of the leading heavyweight boxers of the 20th century .

Notable among these were the first Liston fight ; the `` Fight of the Century '' , `` Super Fight II '' , the `` Thrilla in Manila '' versus his rival Joe Frazier , and `` The Rumble in the Jungle '' versus George Foreman .   At a time when most fighters let their managers do the talking , Ali thrived in and indeed craved the spotlight , where he was often provocative and outlandish . He was known for trash talking , and often freestyled with rhyme schemes and spoken word poetry , both for his trash talking in boxing and as political poetry for his activism , anticipating elements of rap and hip hop music . As a musician , Ali recorded two spoken word albums and a rhythm and blues song , and received two Grammy Award nominations . As an actor , he performed in several films and a Broadway musical . Additionally , Ali wrote two autobiographies , one during and one after his boxing career .   As a Muslim , Ali was initially affiliated with Elijah Muhammad 's Nation of Islam ( NOI ) and advocated their black separatist ideology . He later disavowed the NOI , adhering initially to Sunni Islam and later to Sufism , and supporting racial integration , like his former mentor Malcolm X.   After retiring from boxing in 1981 , Ali devoted his life to religious and charitable work . In 1984 , Ali was diagnosed with Parkinson 's syndrome , which his doctors attributed to boxing-related brain injuries .

Traditionally , the plays are divided into the genres of tragedy , history , and comedy ; they have been translated into every major living language , in addition to being continually performed all around the world .   Many of his plays appeared in print as a series of quartos , but approximately half of them remained unpublished until 1623 , when the posthumous First Folio was published . The traditional division of his plays into tragedies , comedies and histories follows the categories used in the First Folio . However , modern criticism has labelled some of these plays `` problem plays '' that elude easy categorisation , or perhaps purposely break generic conventions , and has introduced the term romances for what scholars believe to be his later comedies .   When Shakespeare first arrived in London in the late 1570s or early 1580s , dramatists writing for London 's new commercial playhouses ( such as The Curtain ) were combining two different strands of dramatic tradition into a new and distinctively Elizabethan synthesis . Previously , the most common forms of popular English theatre were the Tudor morality plays . These plays , celebrating piety generally , use personified moral attributes to urge or instruct the protagonist to choose the virtuous life over Evil . The characters and plot situations are largely symbolic rather than realistic . As a child , Shakespeare would likely have seen this type of play ( along with , perhaps , mystery plays and miracle plays ) .   The other strand of dramatic tradition was classical aesthetic theory . This theory was derived ultimately from Aristotle ; in Renaissance England , however , the theory was better known through its Roman interpreters and practitioners . At the universities , plays were staged in a more academic form as Roman closet dramas . These plays , usually performed in Latin , adhered to classical ideas of unity and decorum , but they were also more static , valuing lengthy speeches over physical action . Shakespeare would have learned this theory at grammar school , where Plautus and especially Terence were key parts of the curriculum and were taught in editions with lengthy theoretical introductions .", "metadata": {}, "summary_text": "William Shakespeare (1564-1616) is renowned for his plays, which are regarded as some of the greatest in English and Western literature.

Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard , more than 1,500 died , making it one of the deadliest commercial peacetime maritime disasters in modern history . The largest ship afloat at the time it entered service , the RMS Titanic was the second of three s operated by the White Star Line , and was built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast . Thomas Andrews , her architect , died in the disaster .   Under the command of Edward Smith , who went down with the ship , Titanic carried some of the wealthiest people in the world , as well as hundreds of emigrants from Great Britain and Ireland , Scandinavia and elsewhere throughout Europe seeking a new life in North America . The first-class accommodation was designed to be the pinnacle of comfort and luxury , with an on-board gymnasium , swimming pool , libraries , high-class restaurants and opulent cabins . A high-power radiotelegraph transmitter was available for sending passenger `` marconigrams '' and for the ship 's operational use . Although Titanic had advanced safety features such as watertight compartments and remotely activated watertight doors , there were not enough lifeboats to accommodate all of those aboard , due to outdated maritime safety regulations . Titanic only carried enough lifeboats for 1,178 people -- slightly more than half of the number on board , and one third of her total capacity .   After leaving Southampton on 10 April 1912 , Titanic called at Cherbourg in France and Queenstown ( now Cobh ) in Ireland before heading west to New York . On 14 April , four days into the crossing and about 375 mi south of Newfoundland , she hit an iceberg at 11:40 p.m. ship 's time . The collision caused the ship 's hull plates to buckle inwards along her starboard ( right ) side and opened five of her sixteen watertight compartments to the sea ; she could only survive four flooding . Meanwhile , passengers and some crew members were evacuated in lifeboats , many of which were launched only partially loaded . A disproportionate number of men were left aboard because of a `` women and children first '' protocol for loading lifeboats . At 2:20 a.m. , she broke apart and foundered -- with well over one thousand people still aboard . Just under two hours after Titanic sank , the Cunard liner arrived at the scene , where she brought aboard an estimated 705 survivors .   The disaster was greeted with worldwide shock and outrage at the huge loss of life and the regulatory and operational failures that had led to it . Public inquiries in Britain and the United States led to major improvements in maritime safety . One of their most important legacies was the establishment in 1914 of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea ( SOLAS ) , which still governs maritime safety today . Additionally , several new wireless regulations were passed around the world in an effort to learn from the many missteps in wireless communications -- which could have saved many more passengers .   The wreck of Titanic , first discovered over 70 years after the sinking , remains on the seabed , split in two and gradually disintegrating at a depth of 12415 ft. Since her discovery in 1985 , thousands of artefacts have been recovered and put on display at museums around the world .

His brother Andrew was also an apostle . According to New Testament accounts , Peter was one of twelve apostles chosen by Jesus from his first disciples . Originally a fisherman , he played a leadership role and was with Jesus during events witnessed by only a few apostles , such as the Transfiguration .

According to Christian tradition , Peter was crucified in Rome under Emperor Nero Augustus Caesar .

He was from Bethsaida in Galilee and the brother of fellow apostle Andrew. Notably, Peter played a significant role in crucial events, including the Transfiguration, and denied Jesus three times before weeping in remorse. Following the resurrection, he preached on Pentecost. \n\nTradition holds that Peter was martyred by crucifixion in Rome under Emperor Nero, requesting to be crucified upside down as he felt unworthy to die like Jesus. His remains are believed to be in St. Peter's Basilica, where a statue is honored annually on June 29.

He pioneered many elements of the suspense and psychological thriller genres . He had a successful career in British cinema with both silent films and early talkies and became renowned as England 's best director . Hitchcock moved to Hollywood in 1939 , and became a U.S. citizen in 1955 .   Hitchcock became a highly visible public figure through interviews , movie trailers , cameo appearances in his own films , and the ten years in which he hosted the television programme Alfred Hitchcock Presents ( 1955 -- 1965 ) . He also fashioned for himself a recognisable directorial style . Hitchcock 's stylistic trademarks include the use of camera movement that mimics a person 's gaze , forcing viewers to engage in a form of voyeurism . In addition , he framed shots to maximise anxiety , fear , or empathy , and used innovative forms of film editing . His work often features fugitives on the run alongside `` icy blonde '' female characters . In 1978 , film critic John Russell Taylor described Hitchcock as `` the most universally recognizable person in the world '' , and `` a straightforward middle-class Englishman who just happened to be an artistic genius '' .   Prior to 1980 , there had long been talk of Hitchcock being knighted for his contribution to film . Critic Roger Ebert wrote : `` Other British directors like Sir Carol Reed and Sir Charlie Chaplin were knighted years ago , while Hitchcock , universally considered by film students to be one of the greatest filmmakers of all time , was passed over '' . Hitchcock later received his knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II in the 1980 New Year Honours .   Hitchcock directed more than fifty feature films in a career spanning six decades and is often regarded as one of the most influential directors in cinematic history . Following a 2007 critics ' poll by Britain 's Daily Telegraph in which he was ranked Britain 's greatest filmmaker , one scholar wrote : `` Hitchcock did more than any director to shape modern cinema , which would be utterly different without him . His flair was for narrative , cruelly withholding crucial information ( from his characters and from the audience ) and engaging the emotions of the audience like no one else .

He also wrote the Beatles ' songs `` Do n't Pass Me By '' and `` Octopus 's Garden '' , and is credited as a co-writer of others , including `` What Goes On '' and `` Flying '' .   Starr was twice afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood , and as a result of prolonged hospitalisations fell behind in school . In 1955 , he entered the workforce and briefly held a position with British Rail before securing an apprenticeship at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer . Soon afterwards , he became interested in the UK skiffle craze , developing a fervent admiration for the genre . In 1957 , he cofounded his first band , the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group , which earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll by early 1958 .

After achieving moderate success with that band in the UK and Hamburg , he quit the Hurricanes and joined the Beatles in August 1962 , replacing Pete Best . Starr played key roles in the Beatles ' films and appeared in numerous others . After the band 's break-up in 1970 , he released several successful singles including the US number four hit `` It Do n't Come Easy '' , and number ones `` Photograph '' and `` You 're Sixteen '' .

He attained the rank of field marshal .   Born into an aristocratic Prussian family with a long history of military service , Manstein joined the army at a young age and saw service on Western Front and Eastern Front during the First World War ( 1914 -- 18 ) . He rose to the rank of captain by the end of the war and was active in the inter-war period helping Germany rebuild her armed forces . In September 1939 , during the invasion of Poland at the beginning of the Second World War , he was serving as Chief of Staff to Gerd von Rundstedt 's Army Group South . Adolf Hitler chose Manstein 's strategy for the invasion of France of May 1940 , a plan later refined by Franz Halder and other members of the OKH . Anticipating a firm Allied reaction should the main thrust of the invasion take place through the Netherlands , Manstein devised an innovative operation -- later known as the Sichelschnitt ( `` sickle cut '' ) -- that called for an attack through the woods of the Ardennes and a rapid drive to the English Channel , thus cutting off the French and Allied armies in Belgium and Flanders . Attaining the rank of general at the end of the campaign , he was active in the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 and the Siege of Sevastopol ( 1941 -- 1942 ) , and was promoted to field marshal on 1 July 1942 . He also participated in the Siege of Leningrad .   Germany 's fortunes in the war began to take an unfavourable turn later in 1942 , especially in the catastrophic Battle of Stalingrad , where Manstein commanded a failed relief effort ( `` Operation Winter Storm '' ) in December . Later known as the `` backhand blow '' , Manstein 's counteroffensive in the Third Battle of Kharkov ( February -- March 1943 ) regained substantial territory and resulted in the destruction of three Soviet armies and the retreat of three others . He was one of the primary commanders at the Battle of Kursk ( July -- August 1943 ) , one of the largest tank battles in history . His ongoing disagreements with Hitler over the conduct of the war led to his dismissal in March 1944 . He never obtained another command and was taken prisoner by the British in August 1945 , several months after Germany 's defeat .   Manstein gave testimony at the main Nuremberg trials of war criminals in August 1946 , and prepared a paper that , along with his later memoirs , helped cultivate the myth of a `` clean Wehrmacht '' -- the myth that the German armed forces were not culpable for the atrocities of the Holocaust . In 1949 he was tried in Hamburg for war crimes and was convicted on nine of seventeen counts , including the poor treatment of prisoners of war and failing to protect civilian lives in his sphere of operations . His sentence of eighteen years in prison was later reduced to twelve , and he served only four years before being released in 1953 . As a military advisor to the West German government in the mid-1950s , he helped re-establish the armed forces . His memoir , Verlorene Siege ( 1955 ) , translated into English as Lost Victories , was highly critical of Hitler 's leadership , and only dealt with the military aspects of the war , ignoring its political and ethical contexts .

As president , Jackson sought to advance the rights of the `` common man '' against a `` corrupt aristocracy '' and to preserve the Union .   He became a practicing lawyer in Tennessee and in 1791 he married Rachel Donelson Robards . Jackson served briefly in the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate . Upon returning to Tennessee , he was appointed a justice on the Tennessee Supreme Court , serving from 1798 until 1804 . In 1801 , Jackson was appointed colonel in the Tennessee militia , and was elected its commander the following year . He led Tennessee militia and U.S. Army regulars during the Creek War of 1813 -- 1814 , winning a major victory at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend . The subsequent Treaty of Fort Jackson required the Creek surrender of vast lands in present-day Alabama and Georgia . Jackson won a decisive victory in the War of 1812 over the British army at the Battle of New Orleans , making him a national hero .

Jackson was a candidate for president in 1824 but , lacking a majority of electoral votes , lost the election in the House of Representatives to John Quincy Adams . In reaction to a `` corrupt bargain '' between opponents Adams and Henry Clay , Jackson 's supporters founded the Democratic Party . He ran again for president in 1828 against Adams and won in a landslide . As president , Jackson faced a threat of secession by South Carolina over the `` Tariff of Abominations '' enacted under Adams . The Nullification Crisis was defused when the tariff was amended and Jackson threatened the use of military force if South Carolina attempted to secede . Congress , led by Clay , attempted to reauthorize the Second Bank of the United States ; Jackson regarded the Bank as a corrupt institution and vetoed the renewal of its charter . After a lengthy struggle , Jackson and the congressional Democrats thoroughly dismantled the Bank . In 1835 , Jackson became the only president to completely pay off the national debt , fulfilling a longtime goal .   In foreign affairs , Jackson 's administration concluded a `` most favored nation '' treaty with Great Britain , settled U.S. claims of damages by France from the Napoleonic Wars , and recognized the Republic of Texas . His presidency marked the beginning of the ascendancy of the `` spoils system '' in American politics . In 1830 , Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act , which relocated most members of the Native American tribes in the South to Indian Territory ( now Oklahoma ) . The relocation process dispossessed the Indians and resulted in widespread death and sickness . In his retirement , Jackson remained active in Democratic Party politics , supporting the presidencies of Martin Van Buren and James K. Polk .   Jackson was widely revered in the United States , but his reputation has declined since the mid-20th century , largely due to his role in Indian removal and support for slavery . Surveys of historians and scholars have ranked Jackson between 6th and 18th most successful among United States presidents .", "metadata": {}, "summary_text": "Andrew Jackson (1767-1845) was the seventh President of the United States, serving from 1829 to 1837, and founded the Democratic Party. Before his presidency, he was a prominent general in the U.S. Army and served briefly in Congress. He aimed to promote the rights of the \"common man\" and preserve the Union. Notable for victories in the Creek War and the War of 1812, particularly at the Battle of New Orleans, he became a national hero. Jackson faced political challenges, including the Nullification Crisis with South Carolina and opposition to the Second Bank of the United States, which he ultimately dismantled.\n\nHis presidency also saw the controversial Indian Removal Act, leading to the forced relocation of Native American tribes, resulting in significant suffering. Jackson was the first president to pay off the national debt entirely and made strides in foreign relations, including treaties with Great Britain and France. Despite being a revered figure in his time, Jackson's legacy has faced criticism, particularly for his role in Indian removal and support for slavery. Historians now rank him between 6th and 18th among U.S. presidents in terms of success."}

Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah ( Christ ) prophesied in the Old Testament .   Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically , although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus . Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry , preaching his message orally and often being referred to as `` rabbi '' . He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities , and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate , the Roman prefect . Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God , performed healings , taught in parables and gathered followers . After his death , his followers believed he rose from the dead , and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church .   His birth is celebrated annually on December 25 ( or various dates in January for some eastern churches ) as a holiday known as Christmas , his crucifixion is honored on Good Friday , and his resurrection is celebrated on Easter . The widely used calendar era `` AD '' , from the Latin anno Domini ( `` in the year of the Lord '' ) , and the alternative `` CE '' , are based on the approximate birth date of Jesus .   Christian doctrines include the beliefs that Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit , was born of a virgin named Mary , performed miracles , founded the Church , died by crucifixion as a sacrifice to achieve atonement , rose from the dead , and ascended into Heaven , whence he will return . Most Christians believe Jesus enables humans to be reconciled to God . The Nicene Creed asserts that Jesus will judge the living and the dead either before or after their bodily resurrection , an event tied to the Second Coming of Jesus in Christian eschatology . The great majority of Christians worship Jesus as the incarnation of God the Son , the second of three persons of a Divine Trinity . A minority of Christian denominations reject Trinitarianism , wholly or partly , as non-scriptural .

Harrison wrote `` My Sweet Lord '' in praise of the Hindu god Krishna , while at the same time intending the lyrics to serve as a call to abandon religious sectarianism through his deliberate blending of the Hebrew word hallelujah with chants of `` Hare Krishna '' and Vedic prayer .

Sometimes called The Virgin Queen , Gloriana or Good Queen Bess , the childless Elizabeth was the last monarch of the Tudor dynasty .   Elizabeth was the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn , his second wife , who was executed two-and-a-half years after Elizabeth 's birth . Anne 's marriage to Henry VIII was annulled , and Elizabeth was declared illegitimate . Her half-brother , Edward VI , ruled until his death in 1553 , bequeathing the crown to Lady Jane Grey and ignoring the claims of his two half-sisters , Elizabeth and the Roman Catholic Mary , in spite of statute law to the contrary . Edward 's will was set aside and Mary became queen , deposing Lady Jane Grey . During Mary 's reign , Elizabeth was imprisoned for nearly a year on suspicion of supporting Protestant rebels .   In 1558 , Elizabeth succeeded her half-sister to the throne and set out to rule by good counsel . She depended heavily on a group of trusted advisers , led by William Cecil , 1st Baron Burghley . One of her first actions as queen was the establishment of an English Protestant church , of which she became the Supreme Governor . This Elizabethan Religious Settlement was to evolve into the Church of England . It was expected that Elizabeth would marry and produce an heir to continue the Tudor line . She never did , despite numerous courtships . As she grew older , Elizabeth became famous for her virginity . A cult grew around her which was celebrated in the portraits , pageants , and literature of the day .   In government , Elizabeth was more moderate than her father and half-siblings had been . One of her mottoes was `` video et taceo '' ( `` I see but say nothing '' ) . In religion , she was relatively tolerant and avoided systematic persecution . After the pope declared her illegitimate in 1570 and released her subjects from obedience to her , several conspiracies threatened her life , all of which were defeated with the help of her ministers ' secret service . Elizabeth was cautious in foreign affairs , manoeuvring between the major powers of France and Spain . She only half-heartedly supported a number of ineffective , poorly resourced military campaigns in the Netherlands , France , and Ireland . By the mid-1580s , England could no longer avoid war with Spain . England 's defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 associated Elizabeth with one of the greatest military victories in English history .   Elizabeth 's reign is known as the Elizabethan era . The period is famous for the flourishing of English drama , led by playwrights such as William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe , and for the seafaring prowess of English adventurers such as Francis Drake . Some historians depict Elizabeth as a short-tempered , sometimes indecisive ruler , who enjoyed more than her share of luck . Towards the end of her reign , a series of economic and military problems weakened her popularity . Elizabeth is acknowledged as a charismatic performer and a dogged survivor in an era when government was ramshackle and limited , and when monarchs in neighbouring countries faced internal problems that jeopardised their thrones . Such was the case with Elizabeth 's rival , Mary , Queen of Scots , whom she imprisoned in 1568 and had executed in 1587 . After the short reigns of Elizabeth 's half-siblings , her 44 years on the throne provided welcome stability for the kingdom and helped forge a sense of national identity .", "metadata": {}, "summary_text": "Elizabeth I (1533-1603) was the Queen of England and Ireland from 1558 until her death and is often referred to as The Virgin Queen or Good Queen Bess.

She became queen after the reign of her half-sister Mary I, who had imprisoned Elizabeth. Her reign marked the establishment of the Church of England and saw her rely heavily on trusted advisers. Despite numerous courtships, Elizabeth never married, leading to a cult of virginity surrounding her.\n\nKnown for her moderate governance and relative religious tolerance, Elizabeth navigated multiple conspiracies against her and cautious foreign relations, particularly with Spain and France. Her reign is noted for the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588, which solidified her legacy. The Elizabethan era is celebrated for its cultural achievements, including the works of Shakespeare and significant naval exploration.

Crown , or royal , colonies were ruled by a governor appointed by the monarch . By the middle of the 19th century , the sovereign appointed royal governors on the advice of the Secretary of State for the Colonies . Under the name of `` royal colony '' , the first of what would later become known as Crown colonies was the English Colony of Virginia in the present-day United States , after the Crown , in 1624 , revoked the royal charter it had granted to the Virginia Company , taking over direct administration .   Until the mid-19th century , the term `` crown colony '' was primarily used to refer to those colonies that had been acquired through wars , such as Trinidad and Tobago and British Guiana , but after that time it was more broadly applied to any colony other than the Presidencies and provinces of British India and the colonies of settlement , such as The Canadas , Newfoundland , British Columbia , New South Wales , Queensland , South Australia , Tasmania , Victoria , Western Australia , and New Zealand , later to become the Dominions .   The term continued to be used until 1981 , when the British Nationality Act 1981 reclassified the remaining British colonies as `` British Dependent Territories '' . By this time , the term `` crown colony '' referred specifically to those colonies ruled directly by a Governor appointed by the Monarch ( as was the case in Hong Kong before the 1997 handover to the People 's Republic of China ) , with or without the assistance of some form of council appointed by the Governor .

The term \"crown colony\" persisted until 1981 when it was redefined under the British Nationality Act, which categorized remaining colonies as \"British Dependent Territories.\" By then, it specifically described those territories directly ruled by a governor, contrasting with self-governed colonies like Bermuda, which had its own internal governance for decades.
