AD 30/33 ) , also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ , was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity . Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah ( Christ ) prophesied in the Old Testament .   Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically , although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus . Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry , preaching his message orally and often being referred to as `` rabbi '' . He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities , and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate , the Roman prefect . Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God , performed healings , taught in parables and gathered followers . After his death , his followers believed he rose from the dead , and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church .   His birth is celebrated annually on December 25 ( or various dates in January for some eastern churches ) as a holiday known as Christmas , his crucifixion is honored on Good Friday , and his resurrection is celebrated on Easter . The widely used calendar era `` AD '' , from the Latin anno Domini ( `` in the year of the Lord '' ) , and the alternative `` CE '' , are based on the approximate birth date of Jesus .   Christian doctrines include the beliefs that Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit , was born of a virgin named Mary , performed miracles , founded the Church , died by crucifixion as a sacrifice to achieve atonement , rose from the dead , and ascended into Heaven , whence he will return . Most Christians believe Jesus enables humans to be reconciled to God . The Nicene Creed asserts that Jesus will judge the living and the dead either before or after their bodily resurrection , an event tied to the Second Coming of Jesus in Christian eschatology . The great majority of Christians worship Jesus as the incarnation of God the Son , the second of three persons of a Divine Trinity . A minority of Christian denominations reject Trinitarianism , wholly or partly , as non-scriptural .   In Islam , Jesus ( commonly transliterated as ) is considered one of God 's important prophets and the Messiah . Muslims believe Jesus was a bringer of scripture and was born of a virgin but was not the Son of God . The Quran states that Jesus himself never claimed divinity . To most Muslims , Jesus was not crucified but was physically raised into Heaven by God .   Judaism rejects the belief that Jesus was the awaited Messiah , arguing that he did not fulfill Messianic prophecies and asserting that his resurrection is a Christian legend .", "metadata": {}}

{"pid": "Vietnam_War", "title_text": "Vietnam War", "passage_text": "The Vietnam War ( Chi\u1ebfn tranh Vi\u1ec7t Nam ) , also known as the Second Indochina War , and known in Vietnam as Resistance War Against America ( Kh\u00e1ng chi\u1ebfn ch\u1ed1ng M\u1ef9 ) or simply the American War , was a war that occurred in Vietnam , Laos , and Cambodia from 1 November 1955 to the fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975 . It was the second of the Indochina Wars and was officially fought between North Vietnam and the government of South Vietnam . The North Vietnamese army was supported by the Soviet Union , China and other communist allies and the South Vietnamese army was supported by the United States , South Korea , Australia , Thailand and other anti-communist allies . The war is therefore considered a Cold War-era proxy war .   The Viet Cong ( also known as the National Liberation Front , or NLF ) , a South Vietnamese communist common front aided by the North , fought a guerrilla war against anti-communist forces in the region , while the People 's Army of Vietnam , also known as the North Vietnamese Army ( NVA ) , engaged in more conventional warfare , at times committing large units to battle . As the war continued , the military actions of the Viet Cong decreased as the role and engagement of the NVA grew . U.S. and South Vietnamese forces relied on air superiority and overwhelming firepower to conduct search and destroy operations , involving ground forces , artillery , and airstrikes . In the course of the war , the U.S. conducted a large-scale strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnam .   The North Vietnamese government and the Viet Cong were fighting to reunify Vietnam . They viewed the conflict as a colonial war and a continuation of the First Indochina War against forces from France and later on the United States . The U.S. government viewed its involvement in the war as a way to prevent a communist takeover of South Vietnam . This was part of the domino theory of a wider containment policy , with the stated aim of stopping the spread of communism worldwide .   Beginning in 1950 , American military advisors arrived in what was then French Indochina.The Military Assistance Advisory Group , Indochina ( with an authorized strength of 128 men ) was set up in September 1950 with a mission to oversee the use and distribution of US military equipment by the French and their allies . U.S. involvement escalated in the early 1960s , with troop levels tripling in 1961 and again in 1962 . U.S. involvement escalated further following the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident , in which a U.S. destroyer clashed with North Vietnamese fast attack craft , which was followed by the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution , which gave the U.S. president authorization to increase U.S. military presence . Regular U.S. combat units were deployed beginning in 1965 . Operations crossed international borders : bordering areas of Laos and Cambodia were heavily bombed by U.S. forces as American involvement in the war peaked in 1968 , the same year that the communist side launched the Tet Offensive . The Tet Offensive failed in its goal of overthrowing the South Vietnamese government , but became the turning point in the war , as it persuaded a large segment of the U.S. population that its government 's claims of progress toward winning the war were illusory despite many years of massive U.S. military aid to South Vietnam .   Gradual withdrawal of U.S. ground forces began as part of `` Vietnamization '' , which aimed to end American involvement in the war while transferring the task of fighting the communists to the South Vietnamese themselves . Despite the Paris Peace Accord , which was signed by all parties in January 1973 , the fighting continued . In the U.S. and the Western world , a large anti-Vietnam War movement developed as part of a larger counterculture . The war changed the dynamics between the Eastern and Western Blocs , and altered North -- South relations .   Direct U.S. military involvement ended on 15 August 1973 . The capture of Saigon by the North Vietnamese Army in April 1975 marked the end of the war , and North and South Vietnam were reunified the following year . The war exacted a huge human cost in terms of fatalities ( see Vietnam War casualties ) . Estimates of the number of Vietnamese soldiers and civilians killed vary from 966,000 to 3.8 million . Some 240,000 -- 300,000 Cambodians , 20,000 -- 62,000 Laotians , and 58,220 U.S. service members also died in the conflict , and a further 1,626 remain missing in action .", "metadata": {}}

He is a former world heavyweight champion of three major sanctioning bodies , having held the titles of the WBA , IBF , and WBO ( twice ) ; additionally he has held the IBO , Ring magazine , and lineal heavyweight titles . A strategic and cerebral boxer , Klitschko is considered to be one of the greatest heavyweight champions of all time , as well as among the hardest punching knockout artists in the history of the division ; his strong jab , straight right hand and left hook being his most formidable weapons .   As an amateur , Klitschko represented Ukraine at the 1996 Olympics , winning a gold medal in the super-heavyweight division . After turning professional later that year , he defeated Chris Byrd in 2000 to win the WBO heavyweight title . Klitschko 's first reign as champion ended in an upset knockout loss to Corrie Sanders in 2003 , which was followed by another knockout loss to Lamon Brewster in 2004 . It was during this time that Klitschko hired Emanuel Steward as his trainer , which began an eight-year partnership that lasted until Steward 's death in 2012 . In particular , Steward was credited with Klitschko 's transition from an aggressive puncher to a more defensively-oriented boxer , much as he had done with Lennox Lewis in 1995 to 2003 .   In 2006 , Klitschko regained a portion of the world heavyweight championship after stopping Chris Byrd in a rematch to win the IBF and IBO titles . He won the WBO title for a second time by defeating then-unbeaten champion Sultan Ibragimov in 2008 . Following his defeat of Ruslan Chagaev in 2009 , Klitschko was awarded the Ring and lineal titles , and lastly he won the WBA title from David Haye in 2011 . Until his defeat by Tyson Fury in 2015 , Klitschko was also recognized as champion by the Transnational Boxing Rankings Board , while the WBA recognized him as one of its `` Super champions '' , a distinction given to boxers who hold that title in addition to those by other sanctioning bodies in the same division .   Overall , he became the second-longest reigning heavyweight champion of all time , and has the second-most successful title defenses total of any heavyweight boxer with 23 ( including his initial reign as WBO champion ) , behind Joe Louis ( 25 ) and ahead of Larry Holmes ( 20 ) and Muhammad Ali ( 19 ) . On 14 September 2015 , BoxRec rated Klitschko as the number one fighter in the world , pound for pound . On 15 November 2014 , he reached a career peak of number two on The Rings pound for pound list . Klitschko has fought in 29 heavyweight title fights , more than any heavyweight champion in the sport 's history . He also holds the record of having defeated the most boxers with an undefeated record , at 12 , and has also defeated ten current or former world champions throughout his career .   Wladimir 's older brother , Vitali Klitschko , is also a former WBC , WBO , and The Ring heavyweight champion . From 2006 until 2015 , Wladimir and Vitali dominated heavyweight boxing , a period typically known as the `` Klitschko Era '' of the division .", "metadata": {}}

The island was governed as an independent commonwealth under the Althing , one of the world 's oldest functioning legislative assemblies . Following a period of civil strife , Iceland acceded to Norwegian rule in the 13th century . The establishment of the Kalmar Union in 1397 united the kingdoms of Norway , Denmark and Sweden . Iceland thus followed Norway 's integration to that Union and came under Danish rule after Sweden 's secession from that union in 1523 . Although the Danish kingdom introduced Lutheranism forcefully in 1550 , Iceland remained a distant semi-colonial territory in which Danish institutions and infrastructures were conspicuous by their absence . In the wake of the French revolution and the Napoleonic wars , Iceland 's struggle for independence took form and culminated in independence in 1918 and the founding of a republic in 1944 . Until the 20th century , Iceland relied largely on subsistence fishing and agriculture , and was among the poorest in Europe . Industrialisation of the fisheries and Marshall Plan aid following World War II brought prosperity , and Iceland became one of the wealthiest and most developed nations in the world . In 1994 , it became a part of the European Economic Area , which further diversified the economy into sectors such as finance , biotechnology , and manufacturing .   Iceland has a market economy with relatively low taxes compared to other OECD countries . It maintains a Nordic social welfare system that provides universal health care and tertiary education for its citizens . Iceland ranks high in economic , political and social stability and equality . In 2013 , it was ranked as the 13th most-developed country in the world by the United Nations ' Human Development Index . Iceland runs almost completely on renewable energy . Affected by the ongoing worldwide financial crisis , the nation 's entire banking system systemically failed in October 2008 , leading to a severe depression , substantial political unrest , the Icesave dispute , and the institution of capital controls . Some bankers were jailed . Since then , the economy has made a significant recovery , in large part due to a surge in tourism .   Icelandic culture is founded upon the nation 's Scandinavian heritage . Most Icelanders are descendants of Germanic and Gaelic settlers . Icelandic , a North Germanic language , is descended from Old Norse and is closely related to Faroese and West Norwegian dialects . The country 's cultural heritage includes traditional Icelandic cuisine , Icelandic literature and medieval sagas . Iceland has the smallest population of any NATO member and is the only one with no standing army , its lightly armed coast guard being in charge of defence .", "metadata": {}}

{"pid": "Cannibalism", "title_text": "Cannibalism", "passage_text": "Cannibalism is the act or practice of humans eating the flesh or internal organs of other human beings . A person who practices cannibalism is called a cannibal . The expression cannibalism has been extended into zoology to mean one individual of a species consuming all or part of another individual of the same species as food , including sexual cannibalism .   The Island Carib people of the Lesser Antilles , from whom the word cannibalism derives , acquired a long-standing reputation as cannibals following the recording of their legends in the 17th century . Some controversy exists over the accuracy of these legends and the prevalence of actual cannibalism in the culture . Cannibalism was widespread in the past among humans in many parts of the world , continuing into the 19th century in some isolated South Pacific cultures , and to the present day in parts of tropical Africa . Cannibalism was practiced in New Guinea and in parts of the Solomon Islands , and flesh markets existed in some parts of Melanesia . Fiji was once known as the `` Cannibal Isles '' . Cannibalism has been well documented around the world , from Fiji to the Amazon Basin to the Congo to M\u0101ori New Zealand . Neanderthals are believed to have practiced cannibalism , and Neanderthals may have been eaten by anatomically modern humans .   Cannibalism has recently been both practiced and fiercely condemned in several wars , especially in Liberia and Congo . It is still practiced in Papua New Guinea as of 2012 for cultic reasons and in ritual and in war in various Melanesian tribes . Cannibalism has been said to test the bounds of cultural relativism as it challenges anthropologists `` to define what is or is not beyond the pale of acceptable human behavior . ''   Cannibalism has been occasionally practiced as a last resort by people suffering from famine , including in modern times . Famous examples include the ill-fated Westward expedition of the Donner Party ( 1846-7 ) and , more recently , the crash of Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 ( 1972 ) , after which some survivors ate the bodies of dead passengers . Also , some mentally ill people obsess about eating others and actually do so , such as Jeffrey Dahmer and Albert Fish . There is resistance to formally labeling cannibalism as a mental disorder .", "metadata": {}}

( TSR ) . The game has been published by Wizards of the Coast ( now a subsidiary of Hasbro ) since 1997 . It was derived from miniature wargames with a variation of the Chainmail game serving as the initial rule system . D&D publication is commonly recognized as the beginning of modern role-playing games and the role-playing game industry .   D&D departs from traditional wargaming and assigns each player a specific character to play instead of a military formation . These characters embark upon imaginary adventures within a fantasy setting . A Dungeon Master serves as the game 's referee and storyteller , while maintaining the setting in which the adventures occur and playing the role of the inhabitants . The characters form a party that interacts with the setting 's inhabitants ( and each other ) . Together they solve dilemmas , engage in battles and gather treasure and knowledge . In the process the characters earn experience points to become increasingly powerful over a series of sessions .   The early success of Dungeons & Dragons led to a proliferation of similar game systems . Despite this competition , D&D remains the market leader in the role-playing game industry . In 1977 , the game was split into two branches : the relatively rules-light game system of Dungeons & Dragons and the more structured , rules-heavy game system of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons ( abbreviated as AD&D or ADnD ) . AD&D 2nd Edition was published in 1989 . In 2000 , the original line of the game was discontinued and the AD&D version was renamed Dungeons & Dragons with the release of its 3rd edition with a new system . These rules formed the basis of the d20 System which is available under the Open Game License ( OGL ) for use by other publishers . Dungeons & Dragons version 3.5 was released in June 2003 , with a ( non-OGL ) 4th edition in June 2008 . A 5th edition was released during the second half of 2014 .   , Dungeons & Dragons remained the best-known and best-selling role-playing game , with an estimated 20 million people having played the game and more than US$ 1 billion in book and equipment sales . The game has been supplemented by many pre-made adventures as well as commercial campaign settings suitable for use by regular gaming groups . Dungeons & Dragons is known beyond the game for other D&D - branded products , references in popular culture , and some of the controversies that have surrounded it , particularly a moral panic in the 1980s falsely linking it to Satanism and suicide .

It can cause a number of symptoms , such as poor ability to tolerate cold , a feeling of tiredness , constipation , depression , and weight gain . Occasionally there may be swelling of the front part of the neck due to goitre . Untreated hypothyroidism during pregnancy can lead to delays in growth and intellectual development in the baby , which is called cretinism .   Worldwide , too little iodine in the diet is the most common cause of hypothyroidism . In countries with enough iodine in the diet , the most common cause of hypothyroidism is the autoimmune condition Hashimoto 's thyroiditis . Less common causes include : previous treatment with radioactive iodine , injury to the hypothalamus or the anterior pituitary gland , certain medications , a lack of a functioning thyroid at birth , or previous thyroid surgery . The diagnosis of hypothyroidism , when suspected , can be confirmed with blood tests measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone ( TSH ) and thyroxine levels .   Prevention at the population level has been with the universal salt iodization . Hypothyroidism can be treated with levothyroxine . The dose is adjusted according to symptoms and normalization of the thyroxine and TSH levels . Thyroid medication is safe in pregnancy . While a certain amount of dietary iodine is important , excessive amounts can worsen certain types of hypothyroidism .   Worldwide about one billion people are estimated to be iodine deficient ; however , it is unknown how often this results in hypothyroidism . In the United States , hypothyroidism occurs in 0.3 -- 0.4 % of people . Subclinical hypothyroidism , a milder form of hypothyroidism characterized by normal thyroxine levels and an elevated TSH level , is thought to occur in 4.3 -- 8.5 % of people in the United States . Hypothyroidism is more common in women than men . People over the age of 60 are more commonly affected . Dogs are also known to develop hypothyroidism and in rare cases cats and horses can also have the disorder . The word `` hypothyroidism '' is from Greek hypo - meaning `` reduced '' , thyreos for `` shield '' , and eidos for `` form . ''", "metadata": {}}

{"pid": "Boyz_II_Men", "title_text": "Boyz II Men", "passage_text": "Boyz II Men is an American R&B vocal group from Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , best known for emotional ballads and acappella harmonies . Formerly a quartet including bass Michael McCary , they are currently a trio composed of baritone Nathan Morris alongside tenors Wanya Morris and Shawn Stockman . During the 1990s , Boyz II Men found fame on Motown Records as a quartet . McCary left the group in 2003 due to health issues and contractual agreements .   During the 1990s , Boyz II Men gained international success . This began with the release of the number one single `` End of the Road '' in 1992 , which reached the top of charts worldwide . `` End of the Road '' would set a new record for longevity , staying at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for thirteen weeks , breaking the decades-old record held by Elvis Presley . Boyz II Men proceeded to break this record with the subsequent releases of `` I 'll Make Love to You '' and `` One Sweet Day '' ( with Mariah Carey ) , which , at fourteen and sixteen weeks respectively , each set new records for the total number of weeks at number one . `` I 'll Make Love to You '' also topped the charts in Australia ( for four weeks ) and garnered international success . As of 2016 , `` One Sweet Day '' still holds the all-time record with sixteen weeks at the top of the Hot 100 .   Consequently , Boyz II Men are top ranking members with regard to time spent at number one in Billboard history , ranking in the fourth spot with 50 weeks ( as of 2014 ) . Furthermore , when `` On Bended Knee '' took the number one spot away from `` I 'll Make Love to You '' , Boyz II Men became only the third artists ever ( after The Beatles and Presley ) to replace themselves at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 . Boyz II Men are among a select group of artists that have held at the number-one spot for at least 50 weeks cumulatively , placing them just fourth on that list behind Elvis Presley , The Beatles , and Mariah Carey . These achievements were enough to earn Boyz II Men recognition as Billboard magazine 's fourth most successful musical group of the 1990s .   Boyz II Men continue to perform worldwide , as a trio . Their most recent studio album , Collide , was released in 2014 .", "metadata": {}}

{"pid": "Huntington's_disease", "title_text": "Huntington's disease", "passage_text": "Huntington 's disease ( HD ) , also known as Huntington 's chorea , is an inherited disorder that results in death of brain cells . The earliest symptoms are often subtle problems with mood or mental abilities . A general lack of coordination and an unsteady gait often follow . As the disease advances , uncoordinated , jerky body movements become more apparent . Physical abilities gradually worsen until coordinated movement becomes difficult and the person is unable to talk . Mental abilities generally decline into dementia . The specific symptoms vary somewhat between people . Symptoms usually begin between 30 and 50 years of age , but can start at any age . The disease may develop earlier in life in each successive generation . About 8 % of cases start before the age of 20 years and typically present with symptoms more similar to Parkinson 's disease . People with HD often underestimate the degree of their problems .   HD is typically inherited from a person 's parents , with 10 % of cases due to a new mutation . The disease is caused by an autosomal dominant mutation in either of an individual 's two copies of a gene called Huntingtin . This means a child of an affected person typically has a 50 % chance of inheriting the disease . The Huntingtin gene provides the genetic information for a protein that is also called `` huntingtin '' . Expansion of CAG ( cytosine-adenine-guanine ) triplet repeats in the gene coding for the Huntingtin protein results in an abnormal protein , which gradually damages cells in the brain , through mechanisms that are not fully understood . Diagnosis is by genetic testing , which can be carried out at any time , regardless of whether or not symptoms are present . This fact raises several ethical debates : the age at which an individual is considered mature enough to choose testing ; whether parents have the right to have their children tested ; and managing confidentiality and disclosure of test results .   There is no cure for HD . Full-time care is required in the later stages of the disease . Treatments can relieve some symptoms and in some improve quality of life . The best evidence for treatment of the movement problems is with tetrabenazine . HD affects about 4 to 15 in 100,000 people of European descent . It is rare among Japanese , while the occurrence rate in Africa is unknown . The disease affects men and women equally . Complications such as pneumonia , heart disease , and physical injury from falls reduce life expectancy . Suicide is the cause of death in about 9 % of cases . Death typically occurs fifteen to twenty years from when the disease was first detected .   The first likely description of the disease was in 1841 by Charles Oscar Waters . The condition was described in further detail in 1872 by George Huntington , after whom it is named . The genetic basis was discovered in 1993 by an international collaborative effort led by the Hereditary Disease Foundation . Research and support organizations began forming in the late 1960s to increase public awareness , to provide support for individuals and their families , and to promote research . Current research directions include determining the exact mechanism of the disease , improving animal models to aid with research , testing of medications to treat symptoms or slow the progression of the disease , and studying procedures such as stem cell therapy with the goal of repairing damage caused by the disease .", "metadata": {}}

It is generally regarded as the longest river in the world , however other conflicting sources cite a 2007 study that gave the title to the Amazon River in South America . The Nile , which is 6,853 km ( 4,258 miles ) long , is an `` international '' river as its drainage basin covers eleven countries , namely , Tanzania , Uganda , Rwanda , Burundi , Congo-Kinshasa , Kenya , Ethiopia , Eritrea , South Sudan , Sudan and Egypt . In particular , the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt and Sudan .   The Nile has two major tributaries , the White Nile and Blue Nile . The White Nile is considered to be the headwaters and primary stream of the Nile itself . The Blue Nile , however , is the source of most of the water and silt . The White Nile is longer and rises in the Great Lakes region of central Africa , with the most distant source still undetermined but located in either Rwanda or Burundi . It flows north through Tanzania , Lake Victoria , Uganda and South Sudan . The Blue Nile ( \u12d3\u1263\u12ed , \u02bf\u0100bay ) begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast . The two rivers meet just north of the Sudanese capital of Khartoum .   The northern section of the river flows north almost entirely through the Sudanese desert to Egypt , then ends in a large delta and flows into the Mediterranean Sea . Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river since ancient times . Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of Aswan , and nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt are found along riverbanks .   In the ancient Egyptian language , the Nile is called \u1e24 ` p\u012b or Iteru ( Hapy ) , meaning `` river '' . In Coptic , the words piaro ( Sahidic ) or phiaro ( Bohairic ) meaning `` the river '' ( lit . p ( h ) . iar-o `` the.canal-great '' ) come from the same ancient name .   The English name Nile and the Arabic names en-N\u00eel and an-N\u00eel both derive from the Latin Nilus and the Ancient Greek \u039d\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 . Beyond that , however , the etymology is disputed . One possible etymology derives it from a Semitic Nahal , meaning `` river '' . The standard English names `` White Nile '' and `` Blue Nile '' , to refer to the river 's source , derive from Arabic names formerly applied only to the Sudanese stretches which meet at Khartoum .", "metadata": {}}

Some of his best known works include the silkscreen paintings Campbell 's Soup Cans ( 1962 ) and Marilyn Diptych ( 1962 ) , the experimental film Chelsea Girls ( 1966 ) , and the multimedia events known as the Exploding Plastic Inevitable ( 1966 -- 67 ) .   Born and raised in Pittsburgh , Warhol initially pursued a successful career as a commercial illustrator . After exhibiting his work in several galleries in the late 1950s , he began to receive recognition as an influential and controversial artist . His New York studio , The Factory , became a well-known gathering place that brought together distinguished intellectuals , drag queens , playwrights , Bohemian street people , Hollywood celebrities , and wealthy patrons . He promoted a collection of personalities known as Warhol superstars , and is credited with coining the widely used expression `` 15 minutes of fame . '' In the late 1960s , he managed and produced the experimental rock band The Velvet Underground and founded Interview magazine . He authored numerous books , including The Philosophy of Andy Warhol and Popism : The Warhol Sixties . He is also notable as a gay man who lived openly as such before the gay liberation movement .

Kazakhstan is the world 's largest landlocked country , and the ninth largest in the world , with an area of 2,724,900 km \u00b2 . Kazakhstan is the dominant nation of Central Asia economically , generating 60 % of the region 's GDP , primarily through its oil/gas industry . It also has vast mineral resources .   Kazakhstan is officially a democratic , secular , unitary , constitutional republic with a diverse cultural heritage . Kazakhstan shares borders with Russia , China , Kyrgyzstan , Uzbekistan , and Turkmenistan , and also adjoins a large part of the Caspian Sea . The terrain of Kazakhstan includes flatlands , steppe , taiga , rock canyons , hills , deltas , snow-capped mountains , and deserts . Kazakhstan has an estimated 18 million people , Given its large land area , its population density is among the lowest , at less than 6 people per square kilometre ( 15 people per sq. mi . ) . The capital is Astana , where it was moved in 1997 from Almaty , the country 's largest city .   The territory of Kazakhstan has historically been inhabited by nomadic tribes . This changed in the 13th century , when Genghis Khan occupied the country as part of the Mongolian Empire . Following internal struggles among the conquerors , power eventually reverted to the nomads . By the 16th century , the Kazakh emerged as a distinct group , divided into three j\u00fcz ( ancestor branches occupying specific territories ) . The Russians began advancing into the Kazakh steppe in the 18th century , and by the mid-19th century , they nominally ruled all of Kazakhstan as part of the Russian Empire . Following the 1917 Russian Revolution , and subsequent civil war , the territory of Kazakhstan was reorganised several times . In 1936 , it was made the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic , part of the Soviet Union .   Kazakhstan was the last of the Soviet republics to declare independence during the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 . The current President , Nursultan Nazarbayev , has been leader of the country since then , and is characterised as authoritarian , with a government history of human rights abuses and suppression of political opposition . Kazakhstan has worked to develop its economy , especially its dominant hydrocarbon industry . Human Rights Watch says that `` Kazakhstan heavily restricts freedom of assembly , speech , and religion , '' and other human rights organisations regularly describe Kazakhstan 's human rights situation as poor .   Kazakhstan 's 131 ethnicities include Kazakhs ( 63 % of the population ) , Russians , Uzbeks , Ukrainians , Germans , Tatars , and Uyghurs . Islam is the religion of about 70 % of the population , with Christianity practised by 26 % ; Kazakhstan officially allows freedom of religion , but religious leaders who oppose the government are suppressed .

His name is cognate with the first element of his Roman equivalent Jupiter . His mythologies and powers are similar , though not identical , to those of the Indo-European deities such as Indra , Jupiter , Perun , Thor , and Odin .   Zeus is the child of Cronus and Rhea , the youngest of his siblings to be born , though sometimes reckoned the eldest as the others required disgorging from Cronus 's stomach . In most traditions , he is married to Hera , by whom he is usually said to have fathered Ares , Hebe , and Hephaestus . At the oracle of Dodona , his consort was said to be Dione , by whom the Iliad states that he fathered Aphrodite . Zeus was also infamous for his erotic escapades . These resulted in many godly and heroic offspring , including Athena , Apollo , Artemis , Hermes , Persephone , Dionysus , Perseus , Heracles , Helen of Troy , Minos , and the Muses .   He was respected as an allfather who was chief of the gods and assigned the others to their roles : `` Even the gods who are not his natural children address him as Father , and all the gods rise in his presence . '' He was equated with many foreign weather gods , permitting Pausanias to observe `` That Zeus is king in heaven is a saying common to all men '' . Zeus ' symbols are the thunderbolt , eagle , bull , and oak .

It was produced by David O. Selznick of Selznick International Pictures and directed by Victor Fleming . Set in the American South against the backdrop of the American Civil War and Reconstruction era , the film tells the story of Scarlett O'Hara , the strong-willed daughter of a Georgia plantation owner , from her romantic pursuit of Ashley Wilkes , who is married to his cousin , Melanie Hamilton , to her marriage to Rhett Butler . The leading roles are portrayed by Vivien Leigh ( Scarlett ) , Clark Gable ( Rhett ) , Leslie Howard ( Ashley ) , and Olivia de Havilland ( Melanie ) .   Production was difficult from the start . Filming was delayed for two years due to Selznick 's determination to secure Gable for the role of Rhett Butler , and the `` search for Scarlett '' led to 1,400 women being interviewed for the part . The original screenplay was written by Sidney Howard , but underwent many revisions by several writers in an attempt to get it down to a suitable length . The original director , George Cukor , was fired shortly after filming had begun and was replaced by Fleming , who in turn was briefly replaced by Sam Wood while Fleming took some time off due to exhaustion .   The film received positive reviews upon its release in December 1939 , although some reviewers found it dramatically lacking and bloated . The casting was widely praised and many reviewers found Leigh especially suited to her role as Scarlett . At the 12th Academy Awards , it received ten Academy Awards ( eight competitive , two honorary ) from thirteen nominations , including wins for Best Picture , Best Director ( Fleming ) , Best Adapted Screenplay ( posthumously awarded to Sidney Howard ) , Best Actress ( Leigh ) , and Best Supporting Actress ( Hattie McDaniel , becoming the first African-American to win an Academy Award ) . It set records for the total number of wins and nominations at the time . The film was immensely popular , becoming the highest-earning film made up to that point , and retained the record for over a quarter of a century . When adjusted for monetary inflation , it is still the most successful film in box-office history .   Gone with the Wind has been criticized as historical revisionism glorifying slavery , but nevertheless , it has been credited for triggering changes to the way African-Americans are depicted cinematically . It was re-released periodically throughout the 20th century and became ingrained in popular culture . The film is regarded as one of the greatest films of all time ; it has placed in the top ten of the American Film Institute 's list of top 100 American films since the list 's inception in 1998 , and in 1989 , the United States Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry .", "metadata": {}}

In its first half Wilde recounts their previous relationship and extravagant lifestyle which eventually led to Wilde 's conviction and imprisonment for gross indecency . He indicts both Lord Alfred 's vanity and his own weakness in acceding to those wishes . In the second half , Wilde charts his spiritual development in prison and identification with Jesus Christ , whom he characterises as a romantic , individualist artist . The letter began `` Dear Bosie '' and ended `` Your Affectionate Friend '' .   Wilde wrote the letter between January and March 1897 , close to the end of his imprisonment . Contact had lapsed between Douglas and Wilde and the latter had suffered from his close supervision , physical labour and emotional isolation . Nelson , the new prison governor , thought that writing might be more cathartic than prison labour . He was not allowed to send the long letter which he was allowed to write `` for medicinal purposes '' ; each page was taken away when completed , and only at the end could he read it over and make revisions . Nelson gave the long letter to him on his release on 18 May 1897 .   Wilde entrusted the manuscript to the journalist Robert Ross ( another former lover , loyal friend and rival to `` Bosie '' ) . Ross published the letter in 1905 , five years after Wilde 's death , giving it the title `` De Profundis '' from Psalm 130 .

{"pid": "Life_imprisonment", "title_text": "Life imprisonment", "passage_text": "Life imprisonment ( also known as a life sentence , lifelong incarceration , or life incarceration ) is any sentence of imprisonment for a crime under which convicted persons are to remain in prison for the rest of their lives or until paroled . Crimes for which a person could receive this sentence include murder , attempted murder , conspiracy to commit murder , blasphemy , terrorism , severe child abuse , rape , espionage , treason , high treason , drug dealing , drug trafficking , drug possession , human trafficking , severe cases of fraud , severe cases of financial crimes , aggravated criminal damage in English law , and aggravated cases of arson , kidnapping , burglary , or robbery which result in death or grievous bodily harm , piracy , and in certain cases genocide , ethnic cleansing , crimes against humanity , certain war crimes or any three felonies in case of three strikes law .   Life imprisonment can , in certain cases , also be imposed for traffic offenses causing death , as a maximum term . Canada and some U.S. states allow judges to impose life imprisonment for such offenses .   This sentence does not exist in all countries . Portugal was the first country in the world to abolish life imprisonment by the prison reforms of Sampaio e Melo in 1884 . However , where life imprisonment is a possible sentence , there may also be formal mechanisms to request parole after a certain period of imprisonment . This means that a convict could be entitled to spend the rest of the sentence ( until that individual dies ) outside prison . Early release is usually conditional on past and future conduct , possibly with certain restrictions or obligations . In contrast , when a fixed term of imprisonment has ended , the convict is free . The length of time served and the conditions surrounding parole vary greatly for each jurisdiction . However , the time until being entitled to apply for parole does not necessarily tell anything about the actual date of parole being granted .   Some technically finite sentences are handed out , especially in the United States , that exceed the human maximum life span and are therefore seen as de facto life sentences . Additionally , for particularly heinous crimes , courts will sometimes add additional years onto the sentence , in addition to life imprisonment , in order to ensure that no amount of good behavior could ever result in the person being set free . For example , Ariel Castro , who kidnapped Michelle Knight , Amanda Berry , and Gina DeJesus from the streets of Cleveland , was sentenced in 2013 to `` life , plus 1,000 years '' for the 937 criminal counts including kidnapping , rape , and murder . Courts in South Africa have handed out at least two sentences that have exceeded a century ( to Moses Sithole and Eugene de Kock ) .   Few countries worldwide allow for minors to be given lifetime sentences that have no provision for eventual release ; these include Antigua and Barbuda , Argentina ( only over the age of 16 ) , Australia , Belize , Brunei , Cuba , Dominica , Saint Vincent and the Grenadines , the Solomon Islands , Sri Lanka , and the United States . According to a University of San Francisco Law School study , only the U.S. had minors serving such sentences in 2008 . In 2009 , Human Rights Watch estimated that there were 2,589 youth offenders serving life without parole in the U.S. . The United States leads in life sentences ( both adults and minors ) , at a rate of 50 people per 100,000 residents imprisoned for life .", "metadata": {}}

The series centers on the Griffins , a family consisting of parents Peter and Lois ; their children Meg , Chris , and Stewie ; and their anthropomorphic pet dog Brian . The show is set in the fictional city of Quahog , Rhode Island , and exhibits much of its humor in the form of cutaway gags that often lampoon American culture .   The family was conceived by MacFarlane after developing two animated films , The Life of Larry and Larry & Steve . MacFarlane redesigned the films ' protagonist , Larry , and his dog , Steve , and renamed them Peter and Brian , respectively . MacFarlane pitched a seven-minute pilot to Fox in 1998 , and the show was greenlit and began production . Shortly after the third season of Family Guy had aired in 2002 , Fox canceled the series , with one episode left unaired . Adult Swim burned off the episode in 2003 , finishing the series ' original run . However , favorable DVD sales and high ratings for syndicated reruns on Adult Swim convinced the network to renew the show in 2004 for a fourth season , which began airing on May 1 , 2005 .   Since its debut on January 31 , 1999 , episodes of Family Guy have been broadcast . Its fifteenth season began on September 25 , 2016 .

Generally considered by critics and fellow players to be one of the greatest tennis players of all time , Agassi has been called the greatest service returner in the history of the game . Described by the BBC upon his retirement as `` perhaps the biggest worldwide star in the sport 's history '' , Agassi compiled performances that , along with his unorthodox apparel and attitude , saw him cited as one of the most charismatic players in the history of the game . As a result , he is credited for helping to revive the popularity of tennis during the 1990s .   In singles tennis , Agassi is an eight-time Grand Slam champion and a 1996 Olympic gold medalist , as well as finishing runner-up in seven other Grand Slam tournaments . During the Open Era , Agassi was the first male player to have won 4 Australian Open titles , a record that was later surpassed by Novak Djokovic when he won his 5th title on 2015 , and then by Roger Federer in 2017 . Agassi is one of five male singles players to achieve the Career Grand Slam in the Open Era and one of eight in history , the first of two to achieve the Career Golden Slam ( Career Grand Slam and Olympic Gold Medal , the other being Rafael Nadal ) , and the only man to win the Career Golden Slam and the ATP Tour World Championships ( won in 1990 ) : a distinction dubbed as a `` Career Super Slam '' by Sports Illustrated .   Agassi was the first male player to win all four Grand Slam tournaments on three different surfaces ( hard , clay and grass ) , and the last American male to win both the French Open ( in 1999 ) and the Australian Open ( in 2003 ) . He also won 17 ATP Masters Series titles and was part of the winning Davis Cup teams in 1990 , 1992 and 1995 . Agassi reached the World No. 1 ranking for the first time in 1995 but was troubled by personal issues during the mid-to-late 1990s and sank to World No. 141 in 1997 , prompting many to believe that his career was over . Agassi returned to World No. 1 in 1999 and enjoyed the most successful run of his career over the next four years . During his 20-plus year tour career , Agassi was known by the nickname `` The Punisher '' .   After suffering from sciatica caused by two bulging discs in his back , a spondylolisthesis ( vertebral displacement ) and a bone spur that interfered with the nerve , Agassi retired from professional tennis on September 3 , 2006 , after losing in the third round of the US Open to Benjamin Becker . He is the founder of the Andre Agassi Charitable Foundation , which has raised over $ 60 million for at-risk children in Southern Nevada . In 2001 , the Foundation opened the Andre Agassi College Preparatory Academy in Las Vegas , a K-12 public charter school for at-risk children .

{"pid": "Water", "title_text": "Water", "passage_text": "Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth 's streams , lakes , and oceans , and the fluids of most living organisms . Its chemical formula is H2O , meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms , that are connected by covalent bonds . Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance , that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure ; but it often refers also to its solid state ( ice ) or its gaseous state ( steam or water vapor ) . It also occurs in nature as snow , glaciers , ice packs and icebergs , clouds , fog , dew , aquifers , and atmospheric humidity .   Water covers 71 % of the Earth 's surface . It is vital for all known forms of life . On Earth , 96.5 % of the planet 's crust water is found in seas and oceans , 1.7 % in groundwater , 1.7 % in glaciers and the ice caps of Antarctica and Greenland , a small fraction in other large water bodies , and 0.001 % in the air as vapor , clouds ( formed of ice and liquid water suspended in air ) , and precipitation . Only 2.5 % of this water is freshwater , and 98.8 % of that water is in ice ( excepting ice in clouds ) and groundwater . Less than 0.3 % of all freshwater is in rivers , lakes , and the atmosphere , and an even smaller amount of the Earth 's freshwater ( 0.003 % ) is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products . A greater quantity of water is found in the earth 's interior .   Water on Earth moves continually through the water cycle of evaporation and transpiration ( evapotranspiration ) , condensation , precipitation , and runoff , usually reaching the sea . Evaporation and transpiration contribute to the precipitation over land . Large amounts of water are also chemically combined or adsorbed in hydrated minerals .   Safe drinking water is essential to humans and other lifeforms even though it provides no calories or organic nutrients . Access to safe drinking water has improved over the last decades in almost every part of the world , but approximately one billion people still lack access to safe water and over 2.5 billion lack access to adequate sanitation . There is a clear correlation between access to safe water and gross domestic product per capita . However , some observers have estimated that by 2025 more than half of the world population will be facing water-based vulnerability . A report , issued in November 2009 , suggests that by 2030 , in some developing regions of the world , water demand will exceed supply by 50 % .   Water plays an important role in the world economy . Approximately 70 % of the freshwater used by humans goes to agriculture . Fishing in salt and fresh water bodies is a major source of food for many parts of the world . Much of long-distance trade of commodities ( such as oil and natural gas ) and manufactured products is transported by boats through seas , rivers , lakes , and canals . Large quantities of water , ice , and steam are used for cooling and heating , in industry and homes . Water is an excellent solvent for a wide variety of chemical substances ; as such it is widely used in industrial processes , and in cooking and washing . Water is also central to many sports and other forms of entertainment , such as swimming , pleasure boating , boat racing , surfing , sport fishing , and diving .", "metadata": {}}

R. Martin , and its television adaptation Game of Thrones . Based on an idea that came to Martin while writing the 1981 novel Windhaven , Tyrion has been called one of the author 's finest creations and most popular characters by The New York Times . Martin has named the character as his favorite in the series .   Introduced in 1996 's A Game of Thrones , Tyrion is a dwarf and member of House Lannister , one of the wealthiest and most powerful families in the fictional kingdom of Westeros . He subsequently appeared in Martin 's A Clash of Kings ( 1998 ) and A Storm of Swords ( 2000 ) . Tyrion was one of a few prominent characters that were not included in 2005 's A Feast for Crows , but returned in the next novel A Dance with Dragons ( 2011 ) . The character will also appear in the forthcoming volume The Winds of Winter . The popularity of the character led Martin and Bantam Books to publish The Wit & Wisdom of Tyrion Lannister , an illustrated collection of Tyrion quotes from the novels , in 2013 .   In the story , Tyrion uses his status as a Lannister to mitigate the impact of the marginalization and derision he has received all of his life -- even from his own family . Knowing that no one will ever take him seriously , he soothes his inadequacies with wine , wit , and self-indulgence . But as the peaceful rule of King Robert Baratheon begins to come apart , Tyrion sees how ill-equipped his family are to hold everything together . He first saves his own neck from the vengeful Catelyn Stark and her sister Lysa Arryn , then is tasked by his father Tywin to impose order on the capital of King 's Landing -- as well as his nephew Joffrey , the new king -- as civil war is sparked . Tyrion struggles to strengthen and protect the city and family who hate him and refuse to see the peril they are in ; when his father returns , Tyrion becomes vulnerable to the wrath and machinations of the self-serving courtiers who surround Joffrey -- including Tyrion 's own scheming sister Cersei . Tyrion escapes death again but at great cost , and in fleeing Westeros finds himself in even more danger , but without his Lannister resources .   Peter Dinklage has garnered enormous praise for his portrayal of the character . In 2011 , Dinklage received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series and later the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Series , Miniseries , or Television Film for his portrayal of Tyrion in the HBO series .

He was also an aerospace engineer , naval aviator , test pilot , and university professor . Before becoming an astronaut , Armstrong was an officer in the U.S. Navy and served in the Korean War . After the war , he earned his bachelor 's degree at Purdue University and served as a test pilot at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics ( NACA ) High-Speed Flight Station , where he logged over 900 flights . He later completed graduate studies at the University of Southern California .   A participant in the U.S. Air Force 's Man in Space Soonest and X-20 Dyna-Soar human spaceflight programs , Armstrong joined the NASA Astronaut Corps in 1962 . He made his first space flight as command pilot of Gemini 8 in March 1966 , becoming NASA 's first civilian astronaut to fly in space . He performed the first docking of two spacecraft , with pilot David Scott . This mission was aborted after Armstrong used some of his reentry control fuel to prevent a dangerous spin caused by a stuck thruster , in the first in-flight space emergency .   Armstrong 's second and last spaceflight was as commander of Apollo 11 , the first manned Moon landing mission in July 1969 . Armstrong and Lunar Module pilot Buzz Aldrin descended to the lunar surface and spent two and a half hours outside the spacecraft , while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the Command/Service Module . Along with Collins and Aldrin , Armstrong was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Richard Nixon . President Jimmy Carter presented Armstrong the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 1978 . Armstrong and his former crewmates received the Congressional Gold Medal in 2009 .   Armstrong died in Cincinnati , Ohio on August 25 , 2012 , at the age of 82 , after complications from coronary artery bypass surgery .", "metadata": {}}

Glaciers slowly deform and flow due to stresses induced by their weight , creating crevasses , seracs , and other distinguishing features . They also abrade rock and debris from their substrate to create landforms such as cirques and moraines . Glaciers form only on land and are distinct from the much thinner sea ice and lake ice that form on the surface of bodies of water .   On Earth , 99 % of glacial ice is contained within vast ice sheets in the polar regions , but glaciers may be found in mountain ranges on every continent except Australia , and on a few high-latitude oceanic islands . Between 35 \u00b0 N and 35 \u00b0 S , glaciers occur only in the Himalayas , Andes , Rocky Mountains , a few high mountains in East Africa , Mexico , New Guinea and on Zard Kuh in Iran . Glaciers cover about 10 percent of Earth 's land surface . Continental glaciers cover nearly 5 e6sqmi or about 98 percent of Antarctica 's 5.1 e6sqmi , with an average thickness of 7,000 ft. Greenland and Patagonia also have huge expanses of continental glaciers .   Glacial ice is the largest reservoir of fresh water on Earth . Many glaciers from temperate , alpine and seasonal polar climates store water as ice during the colder seasons and release it later in the form of meltwater as warmer summer temperatures cause the glacier to melt , creating a water source that is especially important for plants , animals and human uses when other sources may be scant . Within high altitude and Antarctic environments , the seasonal temperature difference is often not sufficient to release meltwater .   Because glacial mass is affected by long-term climatic changes , e.g. , precipitation , mean temperature , and cloud cover , glacial mass changes are considered among the most sensitive indicators of climate change and are a major source of variations in sea level .   A large piece of compressed ice , or a glacier , appears blue as large quantities of water appear blue . This is because water molecules absorb other colors more efficiently than blue . The other reason for the blue color of glaciers is the lack of air bubbles . Air bubbles , which give a white color to ice , are squeezed out by pressure increasing the density of the created ice .", "metadata": {}}

Released in 1967 , the LP was an immediate critical and commercial success , and it is widely regarded as one of the greatest debuts in the history of rock music . The album features Jimi Hendrix 's innovative approach to songwriting and electric guitar playing which soon established a new direction in psychedelic and hard rock music .   By mid-1966 , Hendrix was struggling to earn a living playing the R&B circuit as a backing guitarist . After being referred to Chas Chandler , who was leaving the Animals and interested in managing and producing artists , Hendrix was signed to a management and production contract with Chandler and ex-Animals manager Michael Jeffery . Chandler brought Hendrix to London and began recruiting members for a band designed to showcase the guitarist 's talents , the Jimi Hendrix Experience . In late October , after having been rejected by Decca Records , the Experience signed with Track , a new label formed by the Who 's managers Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp .   Are You Experienced and its preceding singles were recorded over a five-month period from late October 1966 through early April 1967 . The album was completed in sixteen recording sessions at three London locations , including De Lane Lea Studios , CBS , and Olympic . Released in the UK on May 12 , 1967 , Are You Experienced spent 33 weeks on the charts , peaking at number two . The album was issued in the US on August 23 by Reprise Records , where it reached number five on the Billboard 200 , remaining on the chart for 106 weeks , 27 of those in the Top 40 . The album also spent 70 weeks on the US Billboard R&B chart , where it peaked at # 10 . The US version contained some of Hendrix 's best known songs , including the Experience 's first three singles , which , though omitted from the British edition of the LP , were top ten hits in the UK : `` Purple Haze '' , `` Hey Joe '' , and `` The Wind Cries Mary '' .   In 2005 , Rolling Stone ranked Are You Experienced fifteenth on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time . They placed four songs from the album on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time : `` Purple Haze '' ( 17 ) , `` Foxy Lady '' ( 153 ) , `` Hey Joe '' ( 201 ) , and `` The Wind Cries Mary '' ( 379 ) . That same year , the record was one of 50 recordings chosen by the Library of Congress in recognition of its cultural significance to be added to the National Recording Registry . Writer and archivist Reuben Jackson of the Smithsonian Institution wrote : `` it 's still a landmark recording because it is of the rock , R&B , blues ... musical tradition . It altered the syntax of the music ... in a way I compare to James Joyce 's Ulysses . ''", "metadata": {}}

He is currently signed to WWE , where he performs on the SmackDown brand .   Orton is a 13-time world champion . Orton has held the WWE Championship nine times ( eighth reign was as WWE World Heavyweight Champion ) and WWE 's World Heavyweight Championship four times , and was the final holder of the World Heavyweight Championship , which he unified with the WWE Championship to become the WWE World Heavyweight Champion . Orton is a third-generation professional wrestler ; his grandfather Bob Orton , Sr. , his father `` Cowboy '' Bob Orton , and his uncle Barry Orton all competed in the professional wrestling business . Before being promoted to the main World Wrestling Federation ( WWF , now WWE ) roster , Orton trained in and wrestled for Mid-Missouri Wrestling Association-Southern Illinois Conference Wrestling for a month . He was then sent to Ohio Valley Wrestling ( OVW ) , where he held the OVW Hardcore Championship twice .   Orton became a member of the stable Evolution shortly after his WWE debut , which quickly led to an Intercontinental Championship reign , his first title with the company . He also acquired the moniker `` The Legend Killer '' during a storyline where he began disrespecting and then physically attacking WWE Hall of Famers and wrestling veterans . At age 24 , he became the youngest world champion in WWE history after he won the World Heavyweight Championship .

It is the world 's largest religion , with over 2.4 billion followers , or 33 % of the global population , known as Christians . Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah ( the Christ ) was prophesied in the Old Testament .   Christian theology is summarized in creeds such as the Apostles ' Creed and Nicene Creed . These professions of faith state that Jesus suffered , died , was buried , descended into hell , and rose from the dead , in order to grant eternal life to those who believe in him and trust in him for the remission of their sins . The creeds further maintain that Jesus bodily ascended into heaven , where he reigns with God the Father in the unity of the Holy Spirit , and that he will return to judge the living and the dead and grant eternal life to his followers . His incarnation , earthly ministry , crucifixion and resurrection are often referred to as `` the gospel '' , meaning `` good news '' . `` Good news '' is a translation of the Ancient Greek term \u03b5\u1f50\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03ad\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd euang\u00e9lion , from which the terms evangelical and evangelism derive . The term gospel also refers to written accounts of Jesus 's life and teaching , four of which -- Matthew , Mark , Luke and John -- are considered canonical and included in the Christian Bible .   Christianity is an Abrahamic religion that began as a Second Temple Judaic sect in the mid-1st century . Originating in Judea , it quickly spread to Europe , Syria , Mesopotamia , Asia Minor , Transcaucasia , Egypt , Ethiopia and India , and by the end of the 4th century had become the official state church of the Roman Empire . Following the Age of Discovery , Christianity spread to the Americas , Australasia , sub-Saharan Africa and the rest of the world through missionary work and colonization . Christianity has played a prominent role in the shaping of Western civilization .   Throughout its history , Christianity has weathered schisms and theological disputes that have resulted in many distinct churches and denominations . Worldwide , the three largest branches of Christianity are the Catholic Church , the Eastern Orthodox Church and the various denominations of Protestantism . The Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches broke communion with each other in the East -- West Schism of 1054 ; Protestantism came into existence in the Reformation of the 16th century , splitting from the Catholic Church .", "metadata": {}}

By most measures , Italian , together with Sardinian , is the closest to Latin of the Romance languages .  Italian is an official language in Italy , Switzerland , San Marino , Vatican City and western Istria ( in Slovenia and Croatia ) . It used to have official status in Albania , Malta and Monaco , where it is still widely spoken , as well as in former Italian East Africa and Italian North Africa regions where it plays a significant role in various sectors . Italian is spoken by small minorities in places such as France ( especially in Corsica ) , Montenegro , Crimea and Tunisia and by large expatriate communities in the Americas and Australia . It has official minority status in Bosnia and Herzegovina , Croatia , Slovenia and Romania . Many speakers are native bilinguals of both standardized Italian and other regional languages . Italian is the fourth most studied language in the world .   Italian is a major European language , being one of the official languages of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe and one of the working languages of the Council of Europe . It is the third most widely spoken first language in the European Union with 65 million native speakers ( 13 % of the EU population ) and it is spoken as a second language by 14 million EU citizens ( 3 % ) . Including Italian speakers in non-EU European countries ( such as Switzerland and Albania ) and on other continents , the total number of speakers is around 85 million .   Italian is the main working language of the Holy See , serving as the lingua franca in the Roman Catholic hierarchy as well as the official language of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta . Italian is known as the language of music because of its use in musical terminology and opera . Its influence is also widespread in the arts and in the luxury goods market . Italian has been reported as the fourth or fifth most frequently taught foreign language in the world .   Italian was adopted by the state after the Unification of Italy , having previously been a literary language based on Tuscan as spoken mostly by the upper class of Florentine society . Its development was also influenced by other Italian languages and to some minor extent , by the Germanic languages of the post-Roman invaders . The incorporation into Italian of learned , or `` bookish '' words from its own ancestor language , Latin , is arguably another form of lexical borrowing through the influence of written language and the liturgical language of the Church . Throughout the Middle Ages and into the early modern period , most literate Italian speakers were also literate in Latin ; and thus they easily adopted Latin words into their writing -- and eventually speech -- in Italian . Its vowels are the second-closest to Latin after Sardinian . Unlike most other Romance languages , Italian retains Latin 's contrast between short and long consonants . As in most Romance languages , stress is distinctive .", "metadata": {}}

His music videos , including those of `` Beat It '' , `` Billie Jean '' , and `` Thriller '' from his 1982 album Thriller , are credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming the medium into an art form and promotional tool . The popularity of these videos helped bring the television channel MTV to fame . Jackson 's 1987 album Bad spawned the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles `` I Just Ca n't Stop Loving You '' , `` Bad '' , `` The Way You Make Me Feel '' , `` Man in the Mirror '' , and `` Dirty Diana '' , becoming the first album to have five number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100 . He continued to innovate with videos such as `` Black or White '' and `` Scream '' throughout the 1990s , and forged a reputation as a touring solo artist . Through stage and video performances , Jackson popularized a number of complicated dance techniques , such as the robot and the moonwalk , to which he gave the name . His distinctive sound and style has influenced numerous artists of various music genres .   Thriller is the best-selling album of all time , with estimated sales of 65 million copies worldwide . Jackson 's other albums , including Off the Wall ( 1979 ) , Bad ( 1987 ) , Dangerous ( 1991 ) , and HIStory ( 1995 ) , also rank among the world 's best-selling albums . He is recognized as the Most Successful Entertainer of All Time by Guinness World Records . Jackson is one of the few artists to have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice , and was also inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Dance Hall of Fame as the only dancer from pop and rock music . His other achievements include multiple Guinness World Records , 13 Grammy Awards , the Grammy Legend Award , the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award , 26 American Music Awards -- more than any other artist -- including the `` Artist of the Century '' and `` Artist of the 1980s '' , 13 number-one singles in the United States during his solo career -- more than any other male artist in the Hot 100 era -- and estimated sales of over 350 million records worldwide . Jackson won hundreds of awards , making him the most awarded recording artist in the history of popular music . He became the first artist in history to have a top ten single in the Billboard Hot 100 in five different decades when `` Love Never Felt So Good '' reached number nine on May 21 , 2014 . Jackson traveled the world attending events honoring his humanitarianism , and , in 2000 , the Guinness World Records recognized him for supporting 39 charities , more than any other entertainer .   Aspects of Jackson 's personal life , including his changing appearance , personal relationships , and behavior , generated controversy . In 1993 , he was accused of child sexual abuse , but the civil case was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount and no formal charges were brought . In 2005 , he was tried and acquitted of further child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges after the jury found him not guilty on all counts . While preparing for his comeback concert series , This Is It , Jackson died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication on June 25 , 2009 , after suffering from cardiac arrest . The Los Angeles County Coroner ruled his death a homicide , and his personal physician , Conrad Murray , was convicted of involuntary manslaughter . Jackson 's death triggered a global outpouring of grief , and a live broadcast of his public memorial service was viewed around the world . Forbes ranks Jackson the top-earning dead celebrity , with earnings of $ 825 million in 2016 , the highest yearly amount ever recorded by the publication .", "metadata": {}}

It is bordered by Sierra Leone to its west , Guinea to its north and Ivory Coast to its east . It covers an area of 111369 km2 and has a population of 4,503,000 people . English is the official language and over 20 indigenous languages are spoken , representing the numerous tribes who make up more than 95 % of the population . The country 's capital and largest city is Monrovia .   Forests on the coastline are composed mostly of salt-tolerant mangrove trees , while the more sparsely populated inland has forests opening onto a plateau of drier grasslands . The climate is equatorial , with significant rainfall during the May -- October rainy season and harsh harmattan winds the remainder of the year . Liberia possesses about forty percent of the remaining Upper Guinean rainforest . It was an important producer of rubber in the early 20th century .   The Republic of Liberia began as a settlement of the American Colonization Society ( ACS ) , who believed blacks would face better chances for freedom in Africa than in the United States . The country declared its independence on July 26 , 1847 . The U.S. did not recognize Liberia 's independence until during the American Civil War on February 5 , 1862 . Between January 7 , 1822 and the American Civil War , more than 15,000 freed and free-born blacks , who faced legislated limits in the U.S. , and 3,198 Afro-Caribbeans , relocated to the settlement . The black settlers carried their culture with them to Liberia . The Liberian constitution and flag were modeled after those of the U.S. On January 3 , 1848 , Joseph Jenkins Roberts , a wealthy , free-born African American from Virginia who settled in Liberia , was elected as Liberia 's first president after the people proclaimed independence .   Liberia is the only African republic to have self-proclaimed independence without gaining independence through revolt from any other power , and is Africa 's first and oldest modern republic . Liberia retained its independence during the Scramble for Africa . During World War II , Liberia supported the United States war efforts against Germany and in turn the U.S. invested in considerable infrastructure in Liberia to help its war effort , which also aided the country in modernizing and improving its major air transportation facilities . In addition , President William Tubman encouraged economic changes . Internationally , Liberia was a founding member of the League of Nations , United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity .   Political tensions from the rule of William R. Tolbert resulted in a military coup in 1980 that overthrew his leadership soon after his death , marking the beginning of years-long political instability . Five years of military rule by the People 's Redemption Council and five years of civilian rule by the National Democratic Party of Liberia were followed by the First and Second Liberian Civil Wars . These resulted in the deaths and displacement of more than half a million people and devastated Liberia 's economy . A peace agreement in 2003 led to democratic elections in 2005 , in which Ellen Johnson Sirleaf was elected President . Recovery proceeds but about 85 % of the population live below the international poverty line . Liberia 's economic and political stability was threatened in the 2010s by an Ebola virus epidemic ; it originated in Guinea in December 2013 , entered Liberia in March 2014 , and was declared officially ended on May 8 , 2015 .", "metadata": {}}

It is one of the youngest of the major world religions . The fundamental beliefs of Sikhism , articulated in the sacred scripture Guru Granth Sahib , include faith and meditation on the name of the one creator , unity of all humankind , engaging in selfless service , striving for social justice for the benefit and prosperity of all , and honest conduct and livelihood while living a householder 's life . Sikhism has 25-28 million adherents worldwide and is the ninth-largest religion in the world .   Sikhism is based on the spiritual teachings of Guru Nanak , the first Guru , and the ten successive Sikh gurus . Guru Nanak established Kartarpur ( Creator 's town ) around 1520 and gathered the original core of the Sikh Panth ( community ) there . After the death of the tenth Guru , Guru Gobind Singh , the Sikh scripture , Guru Granth Sahib , became the literal embodiment of the eternal , impersonal Guru , where the scripture 's word serves as the spiritual guide for Sikhs . An Indian religion , Sikhism rejects claims that any particular religious tradition has a monopoly on Absolute Truth .   Sikhism emphasizes simran ( meditation on the words of the Guru Granth Sahib ) , that can be expressed musically through kirtan or internally through Nam Japo ( repeat God 's name ) as a means to feel God 's presence , and to have control over the `` Five Thieves '' ( lust , rage , greed , attachment and conceit ) . Hand in hand , secular life is considered to be intertwined with the spiritual life . Guru Nanak taught that living an `` active , creative , and practical life '' of `` truthfulness , fidelity , self-control and purity '' is above the metaphysical truth , and that the ideal man is one who `` establishes union with God , knows His Will , and carries out that Will '' . Guru Hargobind , the sixth Sikh Guru , established the political/temporal ( Miri ) and spiritual ( Piri ) realms to be mutually coexistent .   The development of Sikhism was influenced by the Bhakti movement , however , Sikhism was not simply an extension of the Bhakti movement . Sikhism developed while the region was being ruled by the Mughal Empire . Two of the Sikh gurus -- Guru Arjan and Guru Tegh Bahadur , after they refused to convert to Islam , were tortured and executed by the Mughal rulers . The Islamic era persecution of Sikhs triggered the founding of the Khalsa , as an order for freedom of conscience and religion . A Sikh is expected to embody the qualities of a `` Sant-Sip\u0101h\u012b '' a saint-soldier .", "metadata": {}}

He was the Republican nominee for the 2008 U.S. presidential election .   McCain followed his father and grandfather , both four-star admirals , into the United States Navy , graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1958 . He became a naval aviator , flying ground-attack aircraft from aircraft carriers . During the Vietnam War , he was almost killed in the 1967 USS Forrestal fire . In October 1967 , while on a bombing mission over Hanoi , he was shot down , seriously injured , and captured by the North Vietnamese . He was a prisoner of war until 1973 . McCain experienced episodes of torture , and refused an out-of-sequence early repatriation offer . His war wounds have left him with lifelong physical limitations .   He retired from the Navy as a captain in 1981 and moved to Arizona , where he entered politics . Elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1982 , McCain served two terms . He was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1986 , winning re-election easily five times , most recently in 2016 . While generally adhering to conservative principles , McCain at times has had a media reputation as a `` maverick '' for his willingness to disagree with his party on certain issues . After being investigated and largely exonerated in a political influence scandal of the 1980s as a member of the Keating Five , he made campaign finance reform one of his signature concerns , eventually gaining passage of the McCain -- Feingold Act in 2002 . He is also known for his work in the 1990s to restore diplomatic relations with Vietnam , and for his belief that the Iraq War should have been fought to a successful conclusion . McCain has chaired the Senate Commerce Committee , opposed spending that he considered to be pork barrel , and played a key role in alleviating a crisis over judicial nominations with the bi-partisan group known as the Gang of 14 .   McCain ran for the Republican nomination in 2000 but lost a heated primary season contest to George W. Bush of Texas . He secured the nomination in 2008 after coming back from early reversals , but was defeated by Democratic candidate Barack Obama in the general election , losing by a 365 -- 173 electoral college margin and by 53 -- 46 % in the popular vote . He subsequently adopted more orthodox conservative stances and attitudes and largely opposed actions of the Obama administration , especially in regard to foreign policy matters . By 2013 , however , he had become a key figure in the Senate for negotiating deals on certain issues in an otherwise partisan environment . In 2015 , McCain became chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee .", "metadata": {}}

It stars Liam Neeson as Schindler , Ralph Fiennes as SS officer Amon G\u00f6th , and Ben Kingsley as Schindler 's Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern .   Ideas for a film about the Schindlerjuden ( Schindler Jews ) were proposed as early as 1963 . Poldek Pfefferberg , one of the Schindlerjuden , made it his life 's mission to tell the story of Schindler . Spielberg became interested in the story when executive Sidney Sheinberg sent him a book review of Schindler 's Ark. . Universal Pictures bought the rights to the novel , but Spielberg , unsure if he was ready to make a film about the Holocaust , tried to pass the project to several other directors before finally deciding to direct the film himself .   Principal photography took place in Krak\u00f3w , Poland , over the course of 72 days in 1993 . Spielberg shot the film in black and white and approached it as a documentary . Cinematographer Janusz Kami\u0144ski wanted to give the film a sense of timelessness . John Williams composed the score , and violinist Itzhak Perlman performs the film 's main theme .

Reruns of the series proved to be wildly successful in syndication during the 1970s , which persuaded the series ' then-owner , Paramount Pictures , to expand the franchise .   Paramount originally began work on a Star Trek feature film in 1975 after lobbying by the creator of the franchise , Gene Roddenberry . The studio scrapped the project two years later in favor of creating a television series , Star Trek : Phase II , with the original cast . However , following the huge success of Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind in 1977 , Paramount changed its mind again , halting production on the television series and adapting its pilot episode into a Star Trek feature film , Star Trek : The Motion Picture ( 1979 ) .

Later films were also released on LaserDisc as well . For those films that did not receive an initial DVD release , Paramount released simple one-disc versions with no special features .

Nicknamed `` The Bambino '' and `` The Sultan of Swat '' , he began his MLB career as a stellar left-handed pitcher for the Boston Red Sox , but achieved his greatest fame as a slugging outfielder for the New York Yankees . Ruth established many MLB batting ( and some pitching ) records , including career home runs ( 714 ) , runs batted in ( RBIs ) ( 2,213 ) , bases on balls ( 2,062 ) , slugging percentage ( .6897 ) , and on-base plus slugging ( OPS ) ( 1.164 ) ; the latter two still stand today . Ruth is regarded as one of the greatest sports heroes in American culture and is considered by many to be the greatest baseball player of all time . In , Ruth was elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame as one of its `` first five '' inaugural members .   At age seven , Ruth was sent to St. Mary 's Industrial School for Boys , a reformatory where he learned life lessons and baseball skills from Brother Matthias Boutlier of the Christian Brothers , the school 's disciplinarian and a capable baseball player . In 1914 , Ruth was signed to play minor-league baseball for the Baltimore Orioles but was soon sold to the Red Sox . By 1916 , he had built a reputation as an outstanding pitcher who sometimes hit long home runs , a feat unusual for any player in the pre-1920 dead-ball era . Although Ruth twice won 23 games in a season as a pitcher and was a member of three World Series championship teams with Boston , he wanted to play every day and was allowed to convert to an outfielder . With regular playing time , he broke the MLB single-season home run record in 1919 .   After that season , Red Sox owner Harry Frazee sold Ruth to the Yankees amid controversy . The trade fueled Boston 's subsequent 86 year championship drought and popularized the `` Curse of the Bambino '' superstition . In his 15 years with New York , Ruth helped the Yankees win seven American League ( AL ) championships and four World Series championships . His big swing led to escalating home run totals that not only drew fans to the ballpark and boosted the sport 's popularity but also helped usher in the live-ball era of baseball , in which it evolved from a low-scoring game of strategy to a sport where the home run was a major factor . As part of the Yankees ' vaunted `` Murderer 's Row '' lineup of 1927 , Ruth hit 60 home runs , extending his MLB single-season record . He retired in 1935 after a short stint with the Boston Braves . During his career , Ruth led the AL in home runs during a season twelve times .   Ruth 's legendary power and charismatic personality made him a larger-than-life figure in the Roaring Twenties . During his career , he was the target of intense press and public attention for his baseball exploits and off-field penchants for drinking and womanizing . His often reckless lifestyle was tempered by his willingness to do good by visiting children at hospitals and orphanages . After his retirement as a player , he was denied a managerial job in baseball , most likely due to poor behavior during parts of his playing career . In his final years , Ruth made many public appearances , especially in support of American efforts in World War II . In 1946 , he became ill with cancer , and died two years later .", "metadata": {}}

He governed the Soviet Union from the mid-1920s until his death in 1953 . In this capacity , he served as the Premier of the Soviet Union from 1941 to 1953 and as General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1922 to 1952 . Ideologically a Marxist and a Leninist , he helped to formalise these ideas as Marxism-Leninism while his own policies and theories became known as Stalinism .   Stalin was born to a poor Georgian family in Gori , Russian Empire . After an education at Tiflis Spiritual Seminary , he joined the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party . Affiliated with Vladimir Lenin 's Bolshevik faction , he raised funds via underground activities such as the 1907 Tiflis bank robbery . After the Bolsheviks seized power in 1917 and established a one-party state , Stalin sat on the Politburo during the Russian Civil War . In 1922 Stalin became General Secretary and established the Soviet Union . Despite Lenin 's objection , power consolidated around Stalin and opposition removed following Lenin 's death in 1924 . During Stalin 's tenure the concept of `` Socialism in One Country '' became a central tenet of Soviet society , and a cult of personality developed around Stalin . Lenin 's New Economic Policy was replaced with a centralised command economy , industrialisation and collectivisation . These rapidly transformed the country from an agrarian society into an industrial power , but disrupted food production and contributed to the famine of 1933 -- 34 . Between 1934 and 1939 , Stalin organised the `` Great Purge '' , in which millions of so-called `` enemies of the working class '' , including senior political and military figures , were interned in Gulag-run prisons , exiled or executed , often without due process .   In August 1939 Stalin entered a non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany , resulting in their invasion of Poland in September of that year . Germany ended the pact by invading the Soviet Union in 1941 . Despite initial setbacks , the Soviet Red Army halted the German incursion and captured Berlin in May 1945 , ending World War II in Europe . The Soviet Union annexed the Baltic states and backed the establishment of pro-Soviet Marxist governments both throughout Eastern Europe and in China , North Korea , and North Vietnam . The Soviet Union and United States emerged as the two world superpowers , and a period of tensions began between the Soviet-backed Eastern Bloc and U.S.-backed Western Bloc known as the Cold War . Stalin led the Soviet Union through its post-war reconstruction phase , during which it became the second country to develop a nuclear weapon , as well as launching the Great Plan for the Transformation of Nature in response to another major famine and the Great Construction Projects of Communism . Stalin died in 1953 and was succeeded by Nikita Khrushchev , who denounced Stalin and initiated a de-Stalinisation process .   Stalin is widely considered one of the most significant and influential figures of the 20th century . Stalinism influenced various Marxist-Leninist groups and governments across the world , for whom Stalin was a champion of socialism and the working class . After the fall of the Soviet Union , Stalin has been praised by supporters for his role in defeating Nazi Germany and establishing the Soviet Union as a major world power . Critics emphasise his role in causing millions of deaths and numerous political , religious and ethnic repressions .", "metadata": {}}

It is bordered by Ethiopia to the west , Djibouti to the northwest , the Gulf of Aden to the north , the Indian Ocean to the east , and Kenya to the southwest . Somalia has the longest coastline on Africa 's mainland , and its terrain consists mainly of plateaus , plains and highlands . Climatically , hot conditions prevail year-round , with periodic monsoon winds and irregular rainfall .   Somalia has an estimated population of around 16.3 million . Around 85 % of its residents are ethnic Somalis , who have historically inhabited the northern part of the country . Ethnic minorities are largely concentrated in the southern regions . The official languages of Somalia are Somali and Arabic , both of which belong to the Afroasiatic family . Most people in the country are Muslim , with the majority being Sunni .   In antiquity , Somalia was an important commercial centre . It is among the most probable locations of the fabled ancient Land of Punt . During the Middle Ages , several powerful Somali empires dominated the regional trade , including the Ajuran Empire , the Adal Sultanate , the Warsangali Sultanate , and the Geledi Sultanate . In the late 19th century , through a succession of treaties with these kingdoms , the British and Italian empires gained control of parts of the coast and established the colonies of British Somaliland and Italian Somaliland . In the interior , Mohammed Abdullah Hassan 's Dervish State repelled the British Empire four times and forced it to retreat to the coastal region , before succumbing to defeat in 1920 by British airpower . The toponym Somalia was coined by the Italian explorer Luigi Robecchi Bricchetti ( 1855 -- 1926 ) . Italy acquired full control of the northeastern , central and southern parts of the area after successfully waging the so-called Campaign of the Sultanates against the ruling Majeerteen Sultanate and Sultanate of Hobyo . Italian occupation lasted until 1941 , yielding to British military administration . British Somaliland would remain a protectorate , while Italian Somaliland in 1949 became a United Nations Trusteeship under Italian administration , the Trust Territory of Somaliland . In 1960 , the two regions united to form the independent Somali Republic under a civilian government .   The Supreme Revolutionary Council seized power in 1969 and established the Somali Democratic Republic . Led by Mohamed Siad Barre , this government later collapsed in 1991 as the Somali Civil War broke out . Various armed factions began competing for influence in the power vacuum , particularly in the south . During this period , due to the absence of a central government , Somalia was a `` failed state '' , and residents returned to customary and religious law in most regions . A few autonomous regions , including the Somaliland and Puntland administrations emerged in the north . The early 2000s saw the creation of fledgling interim federal administrations . The Transitional National Government ( TNG ) was established in 2000 , followed by the formation of the Transitional Federal Government ( TFG ) in 2004 , which reestablished national institutions such as the military . In 2006 , the TFG , assisted by Ethiopian troops , assumed control of most of the nation 's southern conflict zones from the newly formed Islamic Courts Union ( ICU ) . The ICU subsequently splintered into more radical groups such as Al-Shabaab , which battled the TFG and its AMISOM allies for control of the region .   By mid-2012 , the insurgents had lost most of the territory that they had seized . In 2011 -- 2012 , a political process providing benchmarks for the establishment of permanent democratic institutions was launched . Within this administrative framework a new provisional constitution was passed in August 2012 , which reformed Somalia as a federation . Following the end of the TFG 's interim mandate the same month , the Federal Government of Somalia , the first permanent central government in the country since the start of the civil war , was formed and a period of reconstruction began in Mogadishu . Somalia has maintained an informal economy , mainly based on livestock , remittances from Somalis working abroad , and telecommunications .", "metadata": {}}

It covers an area of 93,030 km2 , situated in the Carpathian Basin , and is bordered by Slovakia to the north , Romania to the east , Serbia to the south , Croatia to the southwest , Slovenia to the west , Austria to the northwest , and Ukraine to the northeast . With about 10 million inhabitants , Hungary is a medium-sized member state of the European Union . The official language is Hungarian , which is the most widely spoken non-Indo-European language in Europe . Hungary 's capital and largest metropolis is Budapest , a significant economic hub , classified as a global city . Major urban areas include Debrecen , Szeged , Miskolc , P\u00e9cs and Gy\u0151r .   Following centuries of successive habitation by Celts , Romans , Slavs , Gepids and Avars , the foundation of Hungary was laid in the late 9th century by the Hungarian grand prince \u00c1rp\u00e1d in the conquest of the Carpathian Basin . His great-grandson Stephen I ascended to the throne in 1000 , converting the country to a Christian kingdom .

Following the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1526 and about 150 years of partial Ottoman occupation ( 1541 -- 1699 ) , Hungary came under Habsburg rule , and later formed the great power Austro -- Hungarian Empire together with Austria .   Hungary 's current borders were established in 1920 by the Treaty of Trianon after World War I , when the country lost 71 % of its territory , 58 % of its population , and 32 % of ethnic Hungarians . Following the interwar period , Hungary joined the Axis Powers in World War II , suffering significant damage and casualties . Hungary became a satellite state of the Soviet Union , which contributed to the establishment of a four-decade-long communist dictatorship ( 1947 -- 1989 ) . The country gained widespread international attention regarding the Revolution of 1956 and the seminal opening of its previously-restricted border with Austria in 1989 , which accelerated the collapse of the Eastern Bloc . On 23 October 1989 , Hungary again became a democratic parliamentary republic .   In the 21st century , Hungary is a middle power and has the world 's 57th largest economy by nominal GDP , as well as the 58th largest by PPP , out of 188 countries measured by the IMF . As a substantial actor in several industrial and technological sectors , it is both the world 's 36th largest exporter and importer of goods . Hungary is a high-income economy with a very high standard of living . It keeps up a social security and universal health care system , and a tuition-free university education . Hungary performs well in international rankings : it is 20th in quality of life , 25th in inequality-adjusted human development , 32nd in the Social Progress Index , and ranks as the 19th safest country in the world .   Hungary joined the European Union in 2004 and has been part of the Schengen Area since 2007 . Hungary is a member of the United Nations , NATO , WTO , World Bank , the AIIB , the Council of Europe and Visegr\u00e1d Group .

Situated between the Indian and Pacific oceans , it is the world 's largest island country , with more than seventeen thousand islands . At 1,904,569 km2 , Indonesia is the world 's 14th-largest country in terms of land area and world 's 7th-largest country in terms of combined sea and land area . It has an estimated population of over 260 million people and is the world 's fourth most populous country , the most populous Austronesian nation , as well as the most populous Muslim-majority country . The world 's most populous island , Java , contains more than half of the country 's population .   Indonesia 's republican form of government includes an elected legislature and president . Indonesia has 34 provinces , of which five have Special Administrative status . Its capital and country 's most populous city is Jakarta , which is also the most populous city in Southeast Asia and the second in Asia . The country shares land borders with Papua New Guinea , East Timor , and the eastern part of Malaysia . Other neighbouring countries include Singapore , Vietnam , the Philippines , Australia , Palau , and the Indian territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands .

Agriculture mainly produces rice , palm oil , tea , coffee , cacao , medicinal plants , spices and rubber . Indonesia 's major trading partners are Japan , United States , China and the surrounding countries of Singapore , Malaysia and Australia .   The Indonesian archipelago has been an important region for trade since at least the 7th century , when Srivijaya and then later Majapahit traded with China and India . Local rulers gradually absorbed foreign cultural , religious and political models from the early centuries CE , and Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms flourished . Indonesian history has been influenced by foreign powers drawn to its natural resources . Muslim traders and Sufi scholars brought the now-dominant Islam , while European powers brought Christianity and fought one another to monopolise trade in the Spice Islands of Maluku during the Age of Discovery . Following three and a half centuries of Dutch colonialism starting from Amboina and Batavia , and eventually all of the archipelago including Timor and Western New Guinea , at times interrupted by Portuguese , French and British rule , Indonesia secured its independence after World War II .   Indonesia consists of hundreds of distinct native ethnic and linguistic groups , with the largest -- and politically dominant -- ethnic group being the Javanese . The population is unevenly spread throughout the islands within a variety of habitats and levels of development , ranging from the megalopolis of Jakarta to uncontacted tribes in the east . A shared identity has developed , defined by a national language , ethnic diversity , religious pluralism within a Muslim-majority population , and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it . Indonesia 's national motto , `` Bhinneka Tunggal Ika '' ( `` Unity in Diversity '' literally , `` many , yet one '' ) , articulates the diversity that shapes the country . Indonesia 's economy is the world 's 16th largest by nominal GDP and the 8th largest by GDP at PPP , the largest in Southeast Asia , and is considered an emerging market and newly industrialised country . Indonesia has been a member of the United Nations since 1950 .

It was created in 1443 under King Sejong the Great during the Joseon Dynasty . Now , the alphabet is the official script of both South Korea and North Korea , and co-official in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture and Changbai Korean Autonomous County of China 's Jilin Province . In South Korea , Hangul is used primarily to write the Korean language , as using Hanja ( Chinese characters ) in typical Korean writing had fallen out of common usage during the late 1990s .   In its classical and modern forms , the alphabet has 19 consonant and 21 vowel letters . However , instead of being written sequentially like the letters of the Latin alphabet , Hangul letters are grouped into blocks , such as han , each of which transcribes a syllable . That is , although the syllable han may look like a single character , it is actually composed of three letters : h , a , and n. Each syllabic block consists of two to six letters , including at least one consonant and one vowel . These blocks are then arranged horizontally from left to right or vertically from top to bottom . Each Korean word consists of one or more syllables , hence one or more blocks . The number of mathematically possible distinct blocks is 11,172 , though there are far fewer possible syllables allowed by Korean phonotactics , and not all phonotactically possible syllables occur in actual Korean words . Of the 11,172 possible Hangul syllables , the most frequent 256 have a cumulative frequency of 88.2 % ; with the top 512 , it reaches 99.9 % .", "metadata": {}}

He is known as the `` Demon of Screamin ' '' due to his high screams and his wide vocal range . He is also known for his on-stage acrobatics . During his high-energy performances , Tyler usually dresses in bright , colorful outfits with his trademark scarves hanging from his microphone stand .   In the 1970s , Tyler rose to prominence as the lead singer of Aerosmith , which released such milestone hard rock albums as Toys in the Attic and Rocks , along with a string of hit singles , including `` Dream On '' , `` Sweet Emotion '' and `` Walk This Way '' . In the late 1970s and early 1980s , Tyler had a heavy drug and alcohol addiction and the band 's popularity waned . Tyler and bandmate Joe Perry became known as the `` Toxic Twins '' due to their drug abuse . In 1986 , Tyler completed drug rehabilitation and Aerosmith rose to prominence again when Tyler and Perry joined Run -- D.M.C. for a re-make of the classic Aerosmith song `` Walk This Way '' , which became a Top 5 hit . Aerosmith subsequently launched a remarkable comeback with the multi-platinum albums Permanent Vacation , Pump , Get a Grip and Nine Lives , which produced a combined thirteen Top 40 singles and won the band numerous awards . During this time , the band embarked on their longest and most extensive concert tours , promoted their singles with conceptual music videos and made notable appearances in television , film and video games .   In the wake of this success , Tyler emerged as one of the most enduring rock icons . Since the late 1980s , he has embarked on several solo endeavors including guest appearances on other artists ' music ( working with artists as diverse as Alice Cooper , M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce , Santana , Pink and Keith Anderson ) , film and TV roles ( including as a judge on American Idol and several cameo and guest appearances in other programs and films ) , authoring a bestselling book and solo work ( including the Top 40 hit single '' ( It ) Feels So Good '' in 2011 ) . While tension with his Aerosmith bandmates boiled in 2009 and 2010 after he fell off the stage at a concert , had a relapse with prescription drugs ( which he successfully received treatment for in 2009 ) , and signed on to American Idol without telling his bandmates , Tyler has continued to record music and perform with Aerosmith , after more than 46 years in the band .

The Mount Macdonald Tunnel supplements the nearby Connaught Tunnel that the CPR opened in 1916 . Construction commenced in 1984 , and the first revenue train passed through in 1988 . Official inauguration took place May 4 , 1989 . At 14.7 km ( 9.1 miles ) , the Mount Macdonald tunnel is possibly the second-longest ( after Cuajone-El Sargento tunnel in Peru ) railway tunnel in the Americas , rather than the longest . This is suggested because while the source ( an unverified photographer ) says that the Peruvian tunnel is the longest , Google Earth measuring tools show Mount Macdonald Tunnel ( east portal location is 51 \u00b0 20 ' 26.98 '' N , 117 \u00b0 25 ' 27.96 '' W , west portal is 51 \u00b0 15 ' 26.14 '' N , 117 \u00b0 35 ' 02.26 '' W ) as being 48,822 feet ( 14,881 meters ) in length , while the Peruvian tunnel ( north portal is 17 \u00b0 06 ' 28.4 '' S , 70 \u00b0 40 ' 44.64 '' W , south portal is 17 \u00b0 14 ' 15.96 '' S , 70 \u00b0 38 ' 59.07 '' W ) is measured as being 48,263 feet ( 14,710 meters ) long , making the Peruvian tunnel 559 feet ( 171 meters ) shorter . Since both the accuracy of Google Earth 's measurement tools and the source of this photo are unverified , additional verification is needed to determine which of the 2 tunnels is actually longer .   The tunnel and the associated grade revision on the eastern approach to the pass lead to a significantly gentler slope for westbound trains . The new track separates from the old grade at Rogers ( approximately 25 km east of the pass ) and climbs at a lower grade . Numerous new bridges and the 1.9 km Mount Shaughnessy Tunnel were required to reach the pass . The Mount Macdonald Tunnel is 91 m lower than the Connaught Tunnel . On the west side of the pass , the Mount Macdonald Tunnel track rejoins the older line 5.5 km west of the Connaught Tunnel .   The reduction in the westbound ruling grades allowed the Canadian Pacific Railway to remove the pusher locomotives that had been required on the Connaught Tunnel route . This was especially important for the unit coal trains from the Crowsnest Pass area destined for Asian markets through the port of Vancouver , British Columbia . Trains now predominantly travel east through the Connaught Tunnel and west through the Mount Macdonald Tunnel .", "metadata": {}}

Benjamin Franklin , an associate of Galloway , was also a partner with the Chronicle .   The newspaper was established to challenge the power of the Penn family and ultimately the Crown authorities who at that time were placing laws and taxes on the colonists without fair representation in the British Parliament .   The Chronicle was published once a week on a Monday , the first issue being released on January 6 , 1767 , and was printed from a new Bourgeois type set by Goddard 's printing company in Philadelphia , The New Printing Office , on Market-Street , near the Post-Office . The annual subscription rate was ten shillings . The publication maintained operations from January 6 , 1767 , until February 8 , 1774 .   In 1768 William 's sister , Mary Katherine Goddard who later became famous for being the first woman to be a postmaster in Maryland , later joined and managed her brother 's printing office in Philadelphia .   By 1770 the Pennsylvania Chronicle had a circulation of about twenty-five hundred , making it one of the most successful colonial newspapers .   In the middle of the 18th century most of the printing presses that were in use in the American colonies were imported from England . Isaac Doolittle , a New-Haven watch and clock-maker , built the mahogany printing press for Goddard 's Pennsylvania Chronicle in Philadelphia . It was the first printing press built in the American colonies .   Goddard 's newspaper was not without its competition . A rival Philadelphia printer , William Bradford III , founder of The Pennsylvania Journal and Weekly Advertiser in 1742 conducted a newspaper war against Goddard that digressed into personal attacks .   During this time Galloway and Wharton had sold their shares of the Chronicle to a Robert Towne , who in turn made many attempts to persuade Goddard to sell his newspaper to him . After Goddard publicly criticized Galloway and Wharton he subsequently found himself jailed for debt in September 1771 , no doubt at the prompting of the influential Galloway .", "metadata": {}}

It is the largest island of a small , circular archipelago which bears the same name and is the remnant of a volcanic caldera . It forms the southernmost member of the Cyclades group of islands , with an area of approximately 73 km2 and a 2011 census population of 15,550 . The municipality of Santorini includes the inhabited islands of Santorini and Therasia and the uninhabited islands of Nea Kameni , Palaia Kameni , Aspronisi , and Christiana . The total land area is 90.623 km2 . Santorini is part of the Thira regional unit .   Santorini is essentially what remains after an enormous volcanic eruption that destroyed the earliest settlements on a formerly single island , and created the current geological caldera . A giant central , rectangular lagoon , which measures about 12 by , is surrounded by 300 m high , steep cliffs on three sides . The main island slopes downward to the Aegean Sea . On the fourth side , the lagoon is separated from the sea by another much smaller island called Therasia ; the lagoon is connected to the sea in two places , in the northwest and southwest . The depth of the caldera , at 400m , makes it impossible for any but the largest ships to anchor anywhere in the protected bay ; there is also a fisherman 's harbour at Vlychada , on the southwestern coast . The island 's principal port is Athinios . The capital , Fira , clings to the top of the cliff looking down on the lagoon . The volcanic rocks present from the prior eruptions feature olivine , and have a small presence of hornblende .   It is the most active volcanic centre in the South Aegean Volcanic Arc , though what remains today is chiefly a water-filled caldera . The volcanic arc is approximately 500 km long and 20 to wide . The region first became volcanically active around 3 -- 4 million years ago , though volcanism on Thera began around 2 million years ago with the extrusion of dacitic lavas from vents around the Akrotiri .   The island is the site of one of the largest volcanic eruptions in recorded history : the Minoan eruption ( sometimes called the Thera eruption ) , which occurred some 3,600 years ago at the height of the Minoan civilization . The eruption left a large caldera surrounded by volcanic ash deposits hundreds of metres deep and may have led indirectly to the collapse of the Minoan civilization on the island of Crete , 110 km to the south , through a gigantic tsunami . Another popular theory holds that the Thera eruption is the source of the legend of Atlantis .", "metadata": {}}

She continued to reign as Queen of Great Britain and Ireland until her death .   Anne was born in the reign of her uncle Charles II , who had no legitimate children . Her father , James , was first in line to the throne . His suspected Roman Catholicism was unpopular in England , and on Charles 's instructions Anne was raised as an Anglican .

It is the world 's second-largest religion and the fastest-growing major religion in the world , with over 1.8 billion followers or 24.1 % of the global population , known as Muslims . Islam teaches that God who is merciful , all-powerful , and unique has guided mankind through prophets , revealed scriptures and natural signs . The primary scriptures of Islam are the Quran , viewed by Muslims as the verbatim word of God , and the teachings and normative example ( called the sunnah , composed of accounts called hadith ) of Muhammad ( 570 -- 8 June 632 CE ) .   Muslims believe that Islam is the complete and universal version of a primordial faith that was revealed many times before through prophets including Adam , Abraham , Moses , and Jesus . As for the Quran , Muslims consider it to be the unaltered and final revelation of God . Like other Abrahamic religions , Islam also teaches a final judgment with the righteous rewarded paradise and unrighteous are punished in hell . Religious concepts and practices include the five pillars of Islam , which are obligatory acts of worship , and following Islamic law , which touches on virtually every aspect of life and society , from banking and welfare to women and the environment . The cities of Mecca , Medina and Jerusalem are home to the three holiest sites in Islam .   Islam originated in the early 7th century in Mecca , and by the 8th century the Islamic empire extended from Iberia in the west to the Indus River in the east . The Islamic Golden Age refers to the period traditionally dated from the 8th century to the 13th century when much of the historically Islamic world was experiencing a scientific , economic and cultural flourishing . The expansion of the Muslim world involved various caliphates and empires , traders and conversion to Islam by missionary activities .   Most Muslims are of one of two denominations : Sunni ( 75 -- 90 % ) or Shia ( 10 -- 20 % ) . About 13 % of Muslims live in Indonesia , the largest Muslim-majority country , 31 % in South Asia , the largest population of Muslims in the world , 23 % in the Middle East-North Africa , where it is the dominant religion , and 15 % in Sub-Saharan Africa .

He has been influential in popular music and culture for more than five decades . Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s , when his songs chronicled social unrest . Early songs such as `` Blowin ' in the Wind '' and `` The Times They Are a-Changin ' '' became anthems for the Civil Rights Movement and anti-war movement . Leaving behind his initial base in the American folk music revival , his six-minute single `` Like a Rolling Stone '' , recorded in 1965 , enlarged the range of popular music .   Dylan 's lyrics incorporate a wide range of political , social , philosophical , and literary influences . They defied existing pop music conventions and appealed to the burgeoning counterculture . Initially inspired by the performances of Little Richard and the songwriting of Woody Guthrie , Robert Johnson , and Hank Williams , Dylan has amplified and personalized musical genres . His recording career , spanning more than 50 years , has explored the traditions in American song -- from folk , blues , and country to gospel , rock and roll , and rockabilly to English , Scottish , and Irish folk music , embracing even jazz and the Great American Songbook . Dylan performs with guitar , keyboards , and harmonica . Backed by a changing lineup of musicians , he has toured steadily since the late 1980s on what has been dubbed the Never Ending Tour . His accomplishments as a recording artist and performer have been central to his career , but his songwriting is considered his greatest contribution .   Since 1994 , Dylan has published seven books of drawings and paintings , and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries . As a musician , Dylan has sold more than 100 million records , making him one of the best-selling artists of all time . He has also received numerous awards including eleven Grammy Awards , a Golden Globe Award , and an Academy Award . Dylan has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , Minnesota Music Hall of Fame , Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame , and Songwriters Hall of Fame .

The screenplay was written by Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke , partially inspired by Clarke 's short story `` The Sentinel '' . Clarke concurrently wrote the novel 2001 : A Space Odyssey , published soon after the film was released . The film follows a voyage to Jupiter with the sentient computer Hal after the discovery of a mysterious black monolith affecting human evolution . It deals with the themes of existentialism , human evolution , technology , artificial intelligence , and extraterrestrial life . It is noted for its scientifically accurate depiction of space flight , pioneering special effects , and ambiguous imagery . It uses sound and minimal dialogue in place of traditional narrative techniques ; the soundtrack consists of classical music such as Gayane Ballet Suite , The Blue Danube , Also sprach Zarathustra , and pieces from contemporary composer Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti .   2001 : A Space Odyssey was financed and distributed by American studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer , but it was filmed and edited almost entirely in England using the studio facilities of the MGM-British Studios and those of Shepperton Studios , mostly because of the availability of much larger sound stages than in the United States . Production was subcontracted to Kubrick 's production company , and care was taken that the film would be sufficiently British to qualify for subsidy from the Eady Levy . Kubrick had shot his previous two films in England and decided to settle there permanently during filming .   2001 : A Space Odyssey initially received mixed reactions from critics and audiences , but it garnered a cult following and slowly became the highest-grossing North American film of 1968 . It was nominated for four Academy Awards and received one for its visual effects . The sequel 2010 was released in 1984 , directed by Peter Hyams .   Today , 2001 : A Space Odyssey is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made . In 1991 , it was deemed `` culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant '' by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry . The critics ' polls in the 2002 and 2012 editions of Sight & Sound magazine ranked 2001 : A Space Odyssey sixth in the top ten films of all time ; it also tied for second place in the directors ' poll of the same magazine .

{"pid": "Charles_II_of_England", "title_text": "Charles II of England", "passage_text": "Charles II ( 29 May 1630 -- 6 February 1685 ) was king of England , Scotland and Ireland . He was king of Scotland from 1649 until his deposition in 1651 , and king of England , Scotland and Ireland from the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 until his death .   Charles II 's father , Charles I , was executed at Whitehall on 30 January 1649 , at the climax of the English Civil War . Although the Parliament of Scotland proclaimed Charles II king on 5 February 1649 , England entered the period known as the English Interregnum or the English Commonwealth , and the country was a de facto republic , led by Oliver Cromwell . Cromwell defeated Charles II at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651 , and Charles fled to mainland Europe . Cromwell became virtual dictator of England , Scotland and Ireland , and Charles spent the next nine years in exile in France , the Dutch Republic and the Spanish Netherlands . A political crisis that followed the death of Cromwell in 1658 resulted in the restoration of the monarchy , and Charles was invited to return to Britain . On 29 May 1660 , his 30th birthday , he was received in London to public acclaim . After 1660 , all legal documents were dated as if he had succeeded his father as king in 1649 .   Charles 's English parliament enacted laws known as the Clarendon Code , designed to shore up the position of the re-established Church of England . Charles acquiesced to the Clarendon Code even though he favoured a policy of religious tolerance . The major foreign policy issue of his early reign was the Second Anglo-Dutch War . In 1670 , he entered into the secret treaty of Dover , an alliance with his first cousin King Louis XIV of France . Louis agreed to aid him in the Third Anglo-Dutch War and pay him a pension , and Charles secretly promised to convert to Catholicism at an unspecified future date . Charles attempted to introduce religious freedom for Catholics and Protestant dissenters with his 1672 Royal Declaration of Indulgence , but the English Parliament forced him to withdraw it . In 1679 , Titus Oates 's revelations of a supposed `` Popish Plot '' sparked the Exclusion Crisis when it was revealed that Charles 's brother and heir ( James , Duke of York ) was a Catholic . The crisis saw the birth of the pro-exclusion Whig and anti-exclusion Tory parties . Charles sided with the Tories , and , following the discovery of the Rye House Plot to murder Charles and James in 1683 , some Whig leaders were executed or forced into exile . Charles dissolved the English Parliament in 1681 , and ruled alone until his death on 6 February 1685 . He was received into the Roman Catholic Church on his deathbed .   Charles was popularly known as the Merry Monarch , in reference to both the liveliness and hedonism of his court and the general relief at the return to normality after over a decade of rule by Cromwell and the Puritans . Charles 's wife , Catherine of Braganza , bore no live children , but Charles acknowledged at least twelve illegitimate children by various mistresses . He was succeeded by his brother James .", "metadata": {}}
{"pid": "Pluto", "title_text": "Pluto", "passage_text": "Pluto ( minor-planet designation : 134340 Pluto ) is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt , a ring of bodies beyond Neptune . It was the first Kuiper belt object to be discovered .   Pluto was discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930 and was originally considered to be the ninth planet from the Sun . After 1992 , its planethood was questioned following the discovery of several objects of similar size in the Kuiper belt . In 2005 , Eris , a dwarf planet in the scattered disc which is 27 % more massive than Pluto , was discovered . This led the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) to define the term `` planet '' formally in 2006 , during their 26th General Assembly . That definition excluded Pluto and reclassified it as a dwarf planet .   Pluto is the largest and second-most-massive known dwarf planet in the Solar System and the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object directly orbiting the Sun . It is the largest known trans-Neptunian object by volume but is less massive than Eris . Like other Kuiper belt objects , Pluto is primarily made of ice and rock and is relatively small -- about one-sixth the mass of the Moon and one-third its volume . It has a moderately eccentric and inclined orbit during which it ranges from 30 to 49 astronomical units or AU ( 4.4 -- 7.4 billion km ) from the Sun . This means that Pluto periodically comes closer to the Sun than Neptune , but a stable orbital resonance with Neptune prevents them from colliding . Light from the Sun takes about 5.5 hours to reach Pluto at its average distance ( 39.5 AU ) .   Pluto has five known moons : Charon ( the largest , with a diameter just over half that of Pluto ) , Styx , Nix , Kerberos , and Hydra . Pluto and Charon are sometimes considered a binary system because the barycenter of their orbits does not lie within either body .   On July 14 , 2015 , the New Horizons spacecraft became the first spacecraft to fly by Pluto . During its brief flyby , New Horizons made detailed measurements and observations of Pluto and its moons . In September 2016 , astronomers announced that the reddish-brown cap of the north pole of Charon is composed of tholins , organic macromolecules that may be ingredients for the emergence of life , and produced from methane , nitrogen and other gases released from the atmosphere of Pluto and transferred about 19,000 km to the orbiting moon .", "metadata": {}}

In 1990 , she rose to fame with the release of `` Vision of Love '' from her eponymous debut album . The album produced four chart-topping singles in the US and began what would become a string of commercially successful albums which solidified the singer as Columbias highest selling act . Carey and Boyz II Men spent a record sixteen weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100 in 1995 -- 96 with `` One Sweet Day , '' which remains the longest-running number-one song in US chart history . Following a contentious divorce from Sony Music head Tommy Mottola , Carey adopted a new image and traversed towards hip hop with the release of Butterfly ( 1997 ) . In 1998 , she was honored as the world 's best-selling recording artist of the 1990s at the World Music Awards and subsequently named the best-selling female artist of the millennium in 2000 .   Carey parted with Columbia in 2000 , and signed a record-breaking $ 100 million recording contract with Virgin Records America . In the weeks prior to the release of her film Glitter and its accompanying soundtrack in 2001 , she suffered a physical and emotional breakdown and was hospitalized for severe exhaustion . The project was poorly received and led to a general decline in the singer 's career . Carey 's recording contract was bought out for $ 50 million by Virgin and she signed a multi-million dollar deal with Island Records the following year . After a relatively unsuccessful period , she returned to the top of music charts with The Emancipation of Mimi ( 2005 ) . The album became the best-selling album in the US and the second best-seller worldwide in 2005 and produced `` We Belong Together , '' which became her most successful single of the 2000s , and was later named `` Song of the Decade '' by Billboard . Carey once again ventured into film with a well-received supporting role in Precious ( 2009 ) , and was awarded the `` Breakthrough Performance Award '' at the Palm Springs International Film Festival .   Throughout her career , Carey has sold more than 200 million records worldwide , making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time . According to the RIAA , she is the third-best-selling female artist in the United States , with 63.5 million certified albums . With the release of `` Touch My Body '' ( 2008 ) , Carey gained her 18th number-one single in the United States , more than any other solo artist . In 2012 , the singer was ranked second on VH1 's list of the `` 100 Greatest Women in Music . '' Aside from her commercial accomplishments , Carey has won 5 Grammy Awards , 19 World Music Awards , 11 American Music Awards , and 14 Billboard Music Awards and has been consistently credited with inspiring a generation of singers . Referred to as the `` songbird supreme '' by the Guinness World Records , she has a five-octave vocal range , power , melismatic style and signature use of the whistle register .", "metadata": {}}

{"pid": "Western_Romance_languages", "title_text": "Western Romance languages", "passage_text": "Western Romance languages are one of the two subdivisions of a proposed subdivision of the Romance languages based on the La Spezia -- Rimini line . They include the Gallo-Romance and Iberian-Romance branches as well as northern Italian . The subdivision is based solely on the use of the `` s '' for pluralization and the weakening of some consonants , but that makes the categorization highly problematic because there is much higher lexical similarity between all dialects of Italian and French than between French and Spanish . There is also much higher morphological similarity between Spanish and Italian dialects than between Italian and French .   Based on mutual intelligibility , Dalby counts a dozen languages : Portuguese , Spanish , Asturian-Leonese , Aragonese , Catalan , Gascon , Proven\u00e7al , Gallo-Wallon , French , Franco-Proven\u00e7al , Romansh , and Ladin . This classification criterion is however problematic , due to the much higher levels of mutual intelligibility between Italic and Iberian languages than between either of these with Gallo-Romance languages .   Some classifications include Italo-Dalmatian ; the resulting clade is generally called Italo-Western Romance . Other classifications place Italo-Dalmatian with Eastern Romance .   Sardinian does not fit into either Western or Eastern Romance , and may have split off before either .   Today the four most-widely spoken standardized Western Romance languages are Spanish ( c. 410 million native ) , Portuguese ( c. 220 million native , another 45 million or so second-language speakers , mainly in Lusophone Africa ) , French ( c. 75 million native speakers , another 70 million or so second-language speakers , mostly in Francophone Africa ) , and Catalan ( c. 7.2 million native ) .

McCain followed his father and grandfather , both four-star admirals , into the United States Navy , graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1958 . He became a naval aviator , flying ground-attack aircraft from aircraft carriers . During the Vietnam War , he was almost killed in the 1967 USS Forrestal fire . In October 1967 , while on a bombing mission over Hanoi , he was shot down , seriously injured , and captured by the North Vietnamese . He was a prisoner of war until 1973 . McCain experienced episodes of torture , and refused an out-of-sequence early repatriation offer . His war wounds have left him with lifelong physical limitations .   He retired from the Navy as a captain in 1981 and moved to Arizona , where he entered politics . Elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1982 , McCain served two terms . He was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1986 , winning re-election easily five times , most recently in 2016 . While generally adhering to conservative principles , McCain at times has had a media reputation as a `` maverick '' for his willingness to disagree with his party on certain issues . After being investigated and largely exonerated in a political influence scandal of the 1980s as a member of the Keating Five , he made campaign finance reform one of his signature concerns , eventually gaining passage of the McCain -- Feingold Act in 2002 . He is also known for his work in the 1990s to restore diplomatic relations with Vietnam , and for his belief that the Iraq War should have been fought to a successful conclusion . McCain has chaired the Senate Commerce Committee , opposed spending that he considered to be pork barrel , and played a key role in alleviating a crisis over judicial nominations with the bi-partisan group known as the Gang of 14 .   McCain ran for the Republican nomination in 2000 but lost a heated primary season contest to George W. Bush of Texas . He secured the nomination in 2008 after coming back from early reversals , but was defeated by Democratic candidate Barack Obama in the general election , losing by a 365 -- 173 electoral college margin and by 53 -- 46 % in the popular vote .

Martin , who initially envisioned the series as a trilogy , has published five out of a planned seven volumes . The fifth and most recent volume of the series published in 2011 , A Dance with Dragons , took Martin five years to write . He is still writing the sixth novel , The Winds of Winter .   A Song of Ice and Fire takes place on the fictional continents Westeros and Essos . The point of view of each chapter in the story is a limited perspective of a range of characters growing from nine , in the first novel , to thirty-one by the fifth . Three main stories interweave a dynastic war among several families for control of Westeros , the rising threat of the supernatural Others in the northernmost reaches of Westeros , and the ambition of Daenerys Targaryen , the deposed king 's exiled daughter , to assume the Iron Throne .   Martin 's inspirations included the Wars of the Roses and the French historical novels The Accursed Kings by Maurice Druon . A Song of Ice and Fire received praise for its diverse portrayal of women and religion , as well as its realism . An assortment of disparate and subjective points of view confronts the reader , and the success or survival of point of view characters is never assured . Within the often morally ambiguous world of A Song of Ice and Fire , questions concerning loyalty , pride , human sexuality , piety , and the morality of violence frequently arise .   As of April 2015 , the books have sold more than 60 million copies worldwide and , as of January 2017 , have been translated into 47 languages . The fourth and fifth volumes reached the top of The New York Times Best Seller lists upon their releases .

A deaf person has little to no hearing . Hearing loss may occur in one or both ears . In children hearing problems can affect the ability to learn spoken language and in adults it can cause work related difficulties . In some people , particularly older people , hearing loss can result in loneliness . Hearing loss can be temporary or permanent .   Hearing loss may be caused by a number of factors , including : genetics , ageing , exposure to noise , some infections , birth complications , trauma to the ear , and certain medications or toxins . A common condition that results in hearing loss is chronic ear infections . Certain infections during pregnancy such as syphilis and rubella may also cause hearing loss . Hearing loss is diagnosed when hearing testing finds that a person is unable to hear 25 decibels in at least one ear . Testing for poor hearing is recommended for all newborns . Hearing loss can be categorised as mild , moderate , moderate-severe , severe , or profound . There are three main types of hearing loss , conductive hearing loss , sensorineural hearing loss , and mixed hearing loss .   Half of hearing loss is preventable . This includes by immunization , proper care around pregnancy , avoiding loud noise , and avoiding certain medications . The World Health Organization recommends that young people limit the use of personal audio players to an hour a day in an effort to limit exposure to noise . Early identification and support are particularly important in children . For many hearing aids , sign language , cochlear implants and subtitles are useful . Lip reading is another useful skill some develop . Access to hearing aids , however , is limited in many areas of the world .

Most members of Deaf culture oppose attempts to cure deafness and some within this community view cochlear implants with concern as they have the potential to eliminate their culture .

In cultures with an Abrahamic religious influence , evil is usually perceived as the dualistic antagonistic opposite of good , in which good should prevail and evil should be defeated .

The fight matches typically consist of several rounds and take place in an arena , while each character has widely differing abilities but each is relatively viable to choose . Players must master techniques such as blocking , counter-attacking , and chaining attacks together into `` combos '' . Since the early 1990s , most fighting games allow the player to execute special attacks by performing specific input combinations . The fighting game genre is related to but distinct from beat 'em ups , which involve large numbers of enemies against the human player .   The first video game to feature fist fighting was arcade game Heavyweight Champ in , but it was Karate Champ which popularized one-on-one martial arts games in arcades in . In , Yie Ar Kung-Fu featured antagonists with differing fighting styles , while The Way of the Exploding Fist further popularized the genre on home systems . In , Street Fighter introduced hidden special attacks . In , Capcom 's highly successful Street Fighter II refined and popularized many of the conventions of the genre . The fighting game subsequently became the preeminent genre for competitive video gaming in the early to mid-1990s , particularly in arcades . This period spawned dozens of other popular fighting games , including successful and long running franchises like Mortal Kombat , Tekken , The King of Fighters , Virtua Fighter , Guilty Gear , Killer Instinct , Dead or Alive and SoulCalibur .", "metadata": {}}

It is also considered part of Central Africa . Burundi 's capital is Bujumbura . The southwestern border is adjacent to Lake Tanganyika .   The Twa , Hutu and Tutsi peoples have lived in Burundi for at least 500 years . For more than 200 of those years , Burundi was an independent kingdom , until the beginning of the 20th century , when Germany colonised the region . After the First World War and Germany 's defeat , it ceded the territory to Belgium . Both Germans and Belgians ruled Burundi and Rwanda as a European colony known as Ruanda-Urundi . Despite common misconceptions , Burundi and Rwanda had never been under common rule until the time of European colonisation .   Burundi gained independence in 1962 and initially had a monarchy , but a series of assassinations , coups and a general climate of regional instability culminated in the establishment of a republic and one-party state in 1966 . Bouts of ethnic cleansing and ultimately two civil wars and genocides during the 1970s and again in the 1990s left the country undeveloped and its population as one of the world 's poorest . 2015 witnessed large-scale political strife as President Pierre Nkurunziza opted to run for a third term in office , a coup attempt failed and the country 's parliamentary and presidential elections were broadly criticised by members of the international community .   Burundi 's political system is that of a presidential representative democratic republic based upon a multi-party state . The President of Burundi is the head of state and head of government . There are currently 21 registered parties in Burundi . On 13 March 1992 , Tutsi coup leader Pierre Buyoya established a constitution , which provided for a multi-party political process and reflected multi-party competition . Six years later , on 6 June 1998 , the constitution was changed , broadening National Assembly 's seats and making provisions for two vice-presidents . Because of the Arusha Accord , Burundi enacted a transitional government in 2000 . In October 2016 , Burundi informed the UN of its intention to withdraw from the International Criminal Court .   Burundi remains an overwhelmingly rural society , with just 13 % of the population living in urban areas in 2013 . The population density of around 315 people per square kilometre ( 753 per sq mi ) is the second highest in Sub-Saharan Africa . Roughly 85 % of the population are of Hutu ethnic origin , 15 % are Tutsi , and fewer than 1 % are indigenous Twa ( or Pygmies ) . The official languages of Burundi are French and Kirundi , although Swahili can be found spoken along the Tanzanian border .   One of the smallest countries in Africa , Burundi has an equatorial climate . Burundi is a part of the Albertine Rift , the western extension of the East African Rift . The country lies on a rolling plateau in the centre of Africa . The highest peak , Mount Heha at 8810 ft , lies to the southeast of the capital , Bujumbura . The source of the River Nile is in Bururi province , and is linked from Lake Victoria to its headwaters via the Ruvyironza River Another major lake is Lake Tanganyika , located in much of Burundi 's southwestern corner . There are two national parks , Kibira National Park to the northwest ( a small region of rain forest , adjacent to Nyungwe Forest National Park in Rwanda ) , Ruvubu National Park to the northeast ( along the Rurubu River , also known as Ruvubu or Ruvuvu ) . Both were established in 1982 to conserve wildlife populations . Burundi 's lands are mostly agricultural or pasture .   Settlement by rural populations has led to deforestation , soil erosion and habitat loss . Deforestation of the entire country is almost completely due to overpopulation , with a mere 230 mi2 remaining and an ongoing loss of about 9 % per annum . In addition to poverty , Burundians often have to deal with corruption , weak infrastructure , poor access to health and education services , and hunger . Burundi is densely populated and has had substantial emigration as young people seek opportunities elsewhere . The World Happiness Report 2017 ranked Burundi as the world 's second least happy nation with a rank of 154 .", "metadata": {}}

{"pid": "Edgar_Allan_Poe", "title_text": "Edgar Allan Poe", "passage_text": "Edgar Allan Poe ( -LSB- po\u028a -RSB- born Edgar Poe ; January 19 , 1809 -- October 7 , 1849 ) was an American writer , editor , and literary critic . Poe is best known for his poetry and short stories , particularly his tales of mystery and the macabre . He is widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism in the United States and American literature as a whole , and he was one of the country 's earliest practitioners of the short story . Poe is generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre and is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of science fiction . He was the first well-known American writer to try to earn a living through writing alone , resulting in a financially difficult life and career .   Poe was born in Boston , the second child of two actors . His father abandoned the family in 1810 , and his mother died the following year . Thus orphaned , the child was taken in by John and Frances Allan of Richmond , Virginia . They never formally adopted him , but Poe was with them well into young adulthood . Tension developed later as John Allan and Edgar repeatedly clashed over debts , including those incurred by gambling , and the cost of secondary education for the young man . Poe attended the University of Virginia for one semester but left due to lack of money . Poe quarreled with Allan over the funds for his education and enlisted in the Army in 1827 under an assumed name . It was at this time that his publishing career began , albeit humbly , with the anonymous collection of poems Tamerlane and Other Poems ( 1827 ) , credited only to `` a Bostonian '' . With the death of Frances Allan in 1829 , Poe and Allan reached a temporary rapprochement . However , Poe later failed as an officer cadet at West Point , declaring a firm wish to be a poet and writer , and he ultimately parted ways with John Allan .   Poe switched his focus to prose and spent the next several years working for literary journals and periodicals , becoming known for his own style of literary criticism . His work forced him to move among several cities , including Baltimore , Philadelphia , and New York City . In Richmond in 1836 , he married Virginia Clemm , his 13-year-old cousin . In January 1845 , Poe published his poem `` The Raven '' to instant success . His wife died of tuberculosis two years after its publication . For years , he had been planning to produce his own journal The Penn ( later renamed The Stylus ) , though he died before it could be produced .

Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland , the United Kingdom includes the island of Great Britain , the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland and many smaller islands . Northern Ireland is the only part of the United Kingdom that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland.Although Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign state , two of its Overseas Territories also share land borders with other sovereign countries . Gibraltar shares a border with Spain , while the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia share borders with the Republic of Cyprus , the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and the UN buffer zone separating the two Cypriot polities . Apart from this land border , the United Kingdom is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean , with the North Sea to its east , the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west , giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world . The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland . With an area of 242500 km2 , the United Kingdom is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe . It is also the 21st-most populous country , with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants . Together , this makes it the fourth-most densely populated country in the European Union ( EU ) .   The United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of governance . The monarch is Queen Elizabeth II , who has reigned since 6 February 1952 . The capital of the United Kingdom and its largest city is London , a global city and financial centre with an urban area population of 10.3 million , the fourth-largest in Europe and second-largest in the European Union . Other major urban areas in the United Kingdom include the conurbations centred on Birmingham , Leeds , Glasgow , Liverpool and Manchester . The United Kingdom consists of four countries -- England , Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland . The last three have devolved administrations , each with varying powers , based in their capitals , Edinburgh , Cardiff and Belfast , respectively . The nearby Isle of Man , Bailiwick of Guernsey and Bailiwick of Jersey are not part of the United Kingdom , being Crown dependencies with the British Government responsible for defence and international representation .   The relationships among the countries of the UK have changed over time . Wales was annexed by the Kingdom of England under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 . A treaty between England and Scotland resulted in 1707 in a unified Kingdom of Great Britain , which merged in 1801 with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland . Five-sixths of Ireland seceded from the UK in 1922 , leaving the present formulation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.The Anglo-Irish Treaty was signed on 6 December 1921 to resolve the Irish War of Independence . When it took effect one year later , it established the Irish Free State as a separate dominion within the Commonwealth . The UK 's current name was adopted to reflect the change . There are fourteen British Overseas Territories . These are the remnants of the British Empire which , at its height in the 1920s , encompassed almost a quarter of the world 's land mass and was the largest empire in history . British influence can be observed in the language , culture and legal systems of many of its former colonies .   The United Kingdom is a developed country and has the world 's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and ninth-largest economy by purchasing power parity . The UK is considered to have a high-income economy and is categorised as very high in the Human Development Index , ranking 16th in the world . It was the world 's first industrialised country and the world 's foremost power during the 19th and early 20th centuries . The UK remains a great power with considerable economic , cultural , military , scientific and political influence internationally . It is a recognised nuclear weapons state and is seventh in military expenditure in the world . The UK has been a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council since its first session in 1946 . It has been a leading member state of the EU and its predecessor , the European Economic Community ( EEC ) , since 1973 . However , on 23 June 2016 , a national referendum on the UK 's membership of the EU resulted in a decision to leave , and its exit from the EU is currently being negotiated . The UK is also a member of the Commonwealth of Nations , the Council of Europe , the G7 finance ministers , the G7 forum , the G20 , NATO , the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) , and the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) .", "metadata": {}}

It consists of thirteen states and three federal territories and has a total landmass of 330803 km2 separated by the South China Sea into two similarly sized regions , Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia ( Malaysian Borneo ) . Peninsular Malaysia shares a land and maritime border with Thailand and maritime borders with Singapore , Vietnam , and Indonesia . East Malaysia shares land and maritime borders with Brunei and Indonesia and a maritime border with the Philippines and Vietnam . The capital city is Kuala Lumpur , while Putrajaya is the seat of the federal government . With a population of over 30 million , Malaysia is the 44th most populous country . The southernmost point of continental Eurasia , Tanjung Piai , is in Malaysia . Located in the tropics , Malaysia is one of 17 megadiverse countries on earth , with large numbers of endemic species .   Malaysia has its origins in the Malay kingdoms present in the area which , from the 18th century , became subject to the British Empire . The first British territories were known as the Straits Settlements , whose establishment was followed by the Malay kingdoms becoming British protectorates . The territories on Peninsular Malaysia were first unified as the Malayan Union in 1946 . Malaya was restructured as the Federation of Malaya in 1948 , and achieved independence on 31 August 1957 . Malaya united with North Borneo , Sarawak , and Singapore on 16 September 1963 to become Malaysia . Less than two years later in 1965 , Singapore was expelled from the federation .   The country is multi-ethnic and multi-cultural , which plays a large role in politics . About half the population is ethnically Malay , with large minorities of Malaysian Chinese , Malaysian Indians , and indigenous peoples . The constitution declares Islam the state religion while allowing freedom of religion for non-Muslims . The government system is closely modelled on the Westminster parliamentary system and the legal system is based on common law . The head of state is the king , known as the Yang di-Pertuan Agong . He is an elected monarch chosen from the hereditary rulers of the nine Malay states every five years . The head of government is the prime minister .   Since its independence , Malaysia has had one of the best economic records in Asia , with its GDP growing at an average of 6.5 % per annum for almost 50 years . The economy has traditionally been fuelled by its natural resources , but is expanding in the sectors of science , tourism , commerce and medical tourism . Today , Malaysia has a newly industrialised market economy , ranked third largest in Southeast Asia and 29th largest in the world . It is a founding member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations , the East Asia Summit and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation , and a member of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation , the Commonwealth of Nations , and the Non-Aligned Movement .", "metadata": {}}

Shortly before his execution -- after more than a decade of denials -- he confessed to 30 homicides committed in seven states between 1974 and 1978 . The true victim count remains unknown , and could be much higher .   Bundy was regarded by many of his young female victims as handsome and charismatic , traits that he exploited to win their trust . He typically approached them in public places , feigning injury or disability , or impersonating an authority figure , before overpowering and assaulting them at more secluded locations . He sometimes revisited his secondary crime scenes for hours at a time , grooming and performing sexual acts with the decomposing corpses until putrefaction and destruction by wild animals made further interaction impossible . He decapitated at least 12 of his victims , and kept some of the severed heads in his apartment for a period of time as mementos . On a few occasions , he simply broke into dwellings at night and bludgeoned his victims as they slept .   Initially incarcerated in Utah in 1975 for aggravated kidnapping and attempted criminal assault , Bundy became a suspect in a progressively longer list of unsolved homicides in multiple states . Facing murder charges in Colorado , he engineered two dramatic escapes and committed further assaults , including three murders , before his ultimate recapture in Florida in 1978 . He received three death sentences in two separate trials for the Florida homicides .   Bundy died in the electric chair at Raiford Prison in Starke , Florida , on January 24 , 1989 . Biographer Ann Rule described him as `` a sadistic sociopath who took pleasure from another human 's pain and the control he had over his victims , to the point of death , and even after '' . He once called himself `` the most cold-hearted son of a bitch you 'll ever meet '' . Attorney Polly Nelson , a member of his last defense team , agreed : `` Ted '' , she wrote , `` was the very definition of heartless evil . ''", "metadata": {}}

The winners receive the Kenesaw Mountain Landis Memorial Baseball Award , which became the official name of the award in 1944 , in honor of the first MLB commissioner , who served from 1920 until his death on November 25 , 1944 .   MVP voting takes place before the postseason , but the results are not announced until after the World Series . The BBWAA began by polling three writers in each league city in 1938 , reducing that number to two per league city in 1961 . The BBWAA does not offer a clear-cut definition of what `` most valuable '' means , instead leaving the judgment to the individual voters .   First basemen , with 34 winners , have won the most MVPs among infielders , followed by second basemen ( 16 ) , third basemen ( 15 ) , and shortstops ( 15 ) . Of the 24 pitchers who have won the award , 15 are right-handed while 9 are left-handed . Walter Johnson , Carl Hubbell , and Hal Newhouser are the only pitchers who have won multiple times , Newhouser winning consecutively in 1944 and 1945 .   Hank Greenberg , Stan Musial , Alex Rodriguez , and Robin Yount have won at different positions , while Rodriguez is the only player who has won the award with two different teams at two different positions . Barry Bonds has won the most often ( seven times ) and the most consecutively ( 2001 -- 04 ) . Jimmie Foxx was the first player to win multiple times ; 9 players have won three times , and 19 have won twice . Frank Robinson is the only player to win the award in both the American and National Leagues .   The award 's only tie occurred in the National League in 1979 , when Keith Hernandez and Willie Stargell received an equal number of points . There have been 18 unanimous winners , who received all the first-place votes . The New York Yankees have the most winning players with 22 , followed by the St. Louis Cardinals with 17 winners . The award has never been presented to a member of the following four teams : Arizona Diamondbacks , Miami Marlins , New York Mets , and Tampa Bay Rays . The most recent recipients are Mike Trout in the American League and Kris Bryant in the National League .   In recent decades , pitchers have rarely won the award .

He served as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War , and later presided over the 1787 convention that drafted the United States Constitution . He is popularly considered the driving force behind the nation 's establishment and came to be known as the `` father of the country , '' both during his lifetime and to this day .   Washington was widely admired for his strong leadership qualities and was unanimously elected president by the Electoral College in the first two national elections . He oversaw the creation of a strong , well-financed national government that maintained neutrality in the French Revolutionary Wars , suppressed the Whiskey Rebellion , and won acceptance among Americans of all types . Washington 's incumbency established many precedents still in use today , such as the cabinet system , the inaugural address , and the title Mr. President . His retirement from office after two terms established a tradition that lasted until 1940 when Franklin Delano Roosevelt won an unprecedented third term . The 22nd Amendment ( 1951 ) now limits the president to two elected terms .   He was born into the provincial gentry of Colonial Virginia to a family of wealthy planters who owned tobacco plantations and slaves , which he inherited . In his youth , he became a senior officer in the colonial militia during the first stages of the French and Indian War . In 1775 , the Second Continental Congress commissioned him as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army in the American Revolution . In that command , Washington forced the British out of Boston in 1776 but was defeated and nearly captured later that year when he lost New York City .   After crossing the Delaware River in the middle of winter , he defeated the British in two battles ( Trenton and Princeton ) , retook New Jersey , and restored momentum to the Patriot cause . His strategy enabled Continental forces to capture two major British armies at Saratoga in 1777 and Yorktown in 1781 . Historians laud Washington for the selection and supervision of his generals ; preservation and command of the army ; coordination with the Congress , state governors , and their militia ; and attention to supplies , logistics , and training . In battle , however , Washington was repeatedly outmaneuvered by British generals with larger armies .   After victory had been finalized in 1783 , Washington resigned as commander-in-chief rather than seize power , proving his opposition to dictatorship and his commitment to American republicanism . Washington presided over the Constitutional Convention in 1787 , which devised a new form of federal government for the United States . Following his election as president in 1789 , he worked to unify rival factions in the fledgling nation . He supported Alexander Hamilton 's programs to satisfy all debts , federal and state , established a permanent seat of government , implemented an effective tax system , and created a national bank . In avoiding war with Great Britain , he guaranteed a decade of peace and profitable trade by securing the Jay Treaty in 1795 , despite intense opposition from the Jeffersonians . He remained non-partisan , never joining the Federalist Party , although he largely supported its policies . Washington 's Farewell Address was an influential primer on civic virtue , warning against partisanship , sectionalism , and involvement in foreign wars . He retired from the presidency in 1797 , returning to his home and plantation at Mount Vernon .   Upon his death , Washington was eulogized as `` first in war , first in peace , and first in the hearts of his countrymen '' by Representative Henry Lee III of Virginia . He was revered in life and in death ; scholarly and public polling consistently ranks him among the top three presidents in American history . He has been depicted and remembered in monuments , public works , currency , and other dedications to the present day .", "metadata": {}}

Known for her fierce independence and spirited personality , Hepburn was a leading lady in Hollywood for more than 60 years . She appeared in a range of genres , from screwball comedy to literary drama , and she received four Academy Awards for Best Actress -- a record for any performer . In 1999 , Hepburn was named by the American Film Institute as the greatest female star of Classic Hollywood Cinema .   Raised in Connecticut by wealthy , progressive parents , Hepburn began to act while studying at Bryn Mawr College . After four years in the theatre , favorable reviews of her work on Broadway brought her to the attention of Hollywood . Her early years in the film industry were marked with success , including an Academy Award for her third picture , Morning Glory ( 1933 ) , but this was followed by a series of commercial failures that led her to be labeled `` box office poison '' in 1938 . Hepburn masterminded her own comeback , buying out her contract with RKO Radio Pictures and acquiring the film rights to The Philadelphia Story , which she sold on the condition that she be the star . In the 1940s , she was contracted to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer , where her career focused on an alliance with Spencer Tracy . The screen-partnership spanned 25 years and produced nine movies .   Hepburn challenged herself in the latter half of her life , as she regularly appeared in Shakespearean stage productions and tackled a range of literary roles . She found a niche playing middle-aged spinsters , such as in The African Queen ( 1951 ) , a persona the public embraced . Three more Oscars came for her work in Guess Who 's Coming to Dinner ( 1967 ) , The Lion in Winter ( 1968 ) , and On Golden Pond ( 1981 ) . In the 1970s , she began appearing in television films , which became the focus of her career in later life . She remained active into old age , making her final screen appearance in 1994 at the age of 87 . After a period of inactivity and ill health , Hepburn died in 2003 at the age of 96 .   Hepburn famously shunned the Hollywood publicity machine and refused to conform to society 's expectations of women . She was outspoken , assertive , athletic , and wore trousers before it was fashionable for women to do so . She married once , as a young woman , but thereafter lived independently . A 26-year affair with her co-star Spencer Tracy was hidden from the public . With her unconventional lifestyle and the independent characters she brought to the screen , Hepburn epitomized the `` modern woman '' in the 20th-century United States and is remembered as an important cultural figure .", "metadata": {}}

It occupies the western three-eighths of the island , which it shares with the Dominican Republic . Haiti is 27750 km2 in size and has an estimated 10.6 million people , making it the most populous country in the Caribbean Community ( CARICOM ) and the second-most populous country in the Caribbean as a whole .   The region was originally inhabited by the indigenous Ta\u00edno people . Spain discovered the island on 5 December 1492 during the first voyage of Christopher Columbus across the Atlantic . When Columbus initially landed in Haiti , he had thought he had found India or Asia . On Christmas Day 1492 , Columbus ' flagship the Santa Maria ran aground north of what is now Limonade . As a consequence , Columbus ordered his men to salvage what they could from the ship , and he created the first European settlement in the Americas , naming it La Navidad after the day the ship was destroyed .   The island was named La Espa\u00f1ola and claimed by Spain , which ruled until the early 17th century . Competing claims and settlements by the French led to the western portion of the island being ceded to France , which named it Saint-Domingue . The development of sugarcane plantations , worked by slaves brought from Africa , led to the colony being among the most lucrative in the world .   In the midst of the French Revolution ( 1789 -- 1799 ) , slaves and free people of colour revolted in the Haitian Revolution ( 1791 -- 1804 ) , culminating in the abolition of slavery and the defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte 's army at the Battle of Verti\u00e8res . Afterward the sovereign nation of Haiti was established on 1 January 1804 the first independent nation of Latin America and the Caribbean , the second republic in the Americas , the only nation in the western hemisphere to have defeated three European superpowers ( France , Spain , and the UK ) , and the only nation in the world established as a result of a successful slave revolt . The rebellion that began in 1791 was led by a former slave and the first black general of the French Army , Toussaint Louverture , whose military genius and political acumen transformed an entire society of slaves into an independent country . Upon his death in a prison in France , he was succeeded by his lieutenant , Jean-Jacques Dessalines , who declared Haiti 's sovereignty and later became the first Emperor of Haiti , Jacques I . The Haitian Revolution lasted just over a dozen years ; and apart from Alexandre P\u00e9tion , the first President of the Republic , all the first leaders of government were former slaves . The Citadelle Laferri\u00e8re is the largest fortress in the Americas . Henri Christophe former slave and first king of Haiti , Henri I built it to withstand a possible foreign attack .   It is a founding member of the United Nations , Organization of American States ( OAS ) , Association of Caribbean States , and the International Francophonie Organisation . In addition to CARICOM , it is a member of the International Monetary Fund , World Trade Organization , and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States . It has the lowest Human Development Index in the Americas . Most recently , in February 2004 , a coup d'\u00e9tat originating in the north of the country forced the resignation and exile of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide .

They offer the most ranking points , prize money , public and media attention , the greatest strength and size of field , and greater number of `` best of '' sets for men . The Grand Slam itinerary consists of the Australian Open in mid January , the French Open in May and June , Wimbledon in June and July , and the US Open in August and September . Each tournament is played over a period of two weeks . The Australian and United States tournaments are played on hard courts , the French on clay , and Wimbledon on grass . Wimbledon is the oldest , founded in 1877 , followed by the US in 1881 , the French in 1891 , and the Australian in 1905 . However , of these four , only Wimbledon was a major before 1924 -- 25 , the time when all four became designated Grand Slam tournaments . Skipping Grand Slam tournaments -- especially the Australian Open because of the remoteness , the inconvenient dates ( around Christmas and New Year 's Day ) and the low prize money -- was not unusual before 1982 , which was the start of the norm of counting Grand Slam titles .   The term Grand Slam also , and originally , refers to the achievement of winning all four major championships in a single calendar year within one of the five events : men 's and women 's singles ; men 's , women 's , and mixed doubles . In doubles , one team may accomplish a Grand Slam playing together or one player may achieve it with different partners . The term `` Grand Slam '' without qualification refers to winning the four majors in a single calendar year .   Winning the four majors in consecutive tournaments but not in the same year is known as a Non-Calendar Year Grand Slam , while winning all four majors at any point during the course of a career is known as a Career Grand Slam . Winning the gold medal at the Summer Olympic Games in addition to the four majors in a one calendar year is known as a `` Golden Grand Slam '' or more commonly the `` Golden Slam '' . Also , winning the Year-End Championship ( known as ATP World Tour Finals for men 's singles and doubles disciplines , and WTA Tour Championships for both women 's disciplines ) in the same period is known as a `` Super Slam '' . Together , all four Majors in all three disciplines ( singles , doubles , and mixed doubles ) are called a `` boxed set '' of Grand Slam titles .

He was also president of the Government Junta of Chile between 1973 and 1981 . His rule of Chile was a dictatorship .   Pinochet assumed power in Chile following a United States-backed coup d'\u00e9tat on 11 September 1973 that overthrew the democratically elected socialist Unidad Popular government of President Salvador Allende and ended civilian rule . Several academics have stated that the support of the United States was crucial to the coup and the consolidation of power afterward . Pinochet had been promoted to Commander-in-Chief of the Army by Allende on 23 August 1973 , having been its General Chief of Staff since early 1972 . In December 1974 , the ruling military junta appointed Pinochet Supreme Head of the nation by joint decree , although without the support of one of the coup 's instigators , Air Force General Gustavo Leigh .   From the start of the new military government harsh measures were implemented . During the period of Pinochet 's rule , various investigations have identified the murder of 1,200 to 3,200 people with up to 80,000 people forcibly interned and as many as 30,000 tortured . According to the Chilean government , the official number of deaths and forced disappearances stands at 3,095 .   Under the influence of the free market-oriented neoliberal `` Chicago Boys '' , the military government implemented economic liberalization , including currency stabilization , removed tariff protections for local industry , banned trade unions and privatized social security and hundreds of state-owned enterprises . These policies produced what has been referred to as the `` Miracle of Chile , '' but critics state that economic inequality dramatically increased and attribute the devastating effects of the 1982 monetary crisis on the Chilean economy to these policies . Chile was , for most of the 1990s , the best-performing economy in Latin America , though the legacy of Pinochet 's reforms continues to be in dispute .   Pinochet 's 17-year rule was given a legal framework through a controversial 1980 plebiscite , which approved a new Constitution drafted by a government-appointed commission . In a 1988 plebiscite 56 % voted against Pinochet 's continuing as president , which led to democratic elections for the Presidency and Congress . After stepping down in 1990 , Pinochet continued to serve as Commander-in-Chief of the Chilean Army until 10 March 1998 , when he retired and became a senator-for-life in accordance with his 1980 Constitution . However , Pinochet was arrested under an international arrest warrant on a visit to London on 10 October 1998 in connection with numerous human rights violations . Following a legal battle he was released on grounds of ill-health , and returned to Chile on 3 March 2000 . In 2004 , Chilean Judge Juan Guzm\u00e1n Tapia ruled that Pinochet was medically fit to stand trial and placed him under house arrest . By the time of his death on 10 December 2006 , about 300 criminal charges were still pending against him in Chile for numerous human rights violations during his 17-year rule , and tax evasion and embezzlement during and after his rule ; he was accused of having corruptly amassed at least 28 million USD . Despite the indictment and 300 charges , he only served time in house arrest .", "metadata": {}}

It has a population of 26.4 million and is the 93rd largest country by area . Bordering China in the north and India in the south , east , and west , it is the largest sovereign Himalayan state . Nepal does not border Bangladesh , which is located within only 27 km ( 17 mi ) of its southeastern tip . Neither does it border Bhutan due to the Indian state of Sikkim being located in between . Nepal has a diverse geography , including fertile plains , subalpine forested hills , and eight of the world 's ten tallest mountains , including Mount Everest , the highest point on Earth . Kathmandu is the nation 's capital and largest city . It is a multiethnic nation with Nepali as the official language .   The territory of Nepal has a recorded history since the Neolithic age . The name `` Nepal '' is first recorded in texts from the Vedic Age , the era which founded Hinduism , the predominant religion of the country . In the middle of the first millennium BCE , Gautama Buddha , the founder of Buddhism , was born in southern Nepal . Parts of northern Nepal were intertwined with the culture of Tibet . The Kathmandu Valley in central Nepal became known as Nepal proper because of its complex urban civilisation . It was the seat of the prosperous Newar confederacy known as Nepal Mandala . The Himalayan branch of the ancient Silk Road was dominated by the valley 's traders . The cosmopolitan region developed distinct traditional art and architecture . By the 18th century , the Gorkha Kingdom achieved the unification of Nepal . The Shah dynasty established the Kingdom of Nepal and later formed an alliance with the British Empire , under its Rana dynasty of premiers . The country was never colonised but served as a buffer state between Imperial China and Colonial India . In the 20th century , Nepal ended its isolation and forged strong ties with regional powers . Parliamentary democracy was introduced in 1951 , but was twice suspended by Nepalese monarchs in 1960 and 2005 . The Nepalese Civil War resulted in the proclamation of a republic in 2008 , ending the reign of the world 's last Hindu monarchy .   Modern Nepal is a federal secular parliamentary republic . It has seven states . Nepal is a developing nation , ranking 144th on the Human Development Index ( HDI ) in 2016 . The country struggles with the transition from a monarchy to a republic . It also suffers from high levels of hunger and poverty . Despite these challenges , Nepal is making steady progress , with the government declaring its commitment to elevate the nation from least developed country status by 2022 . Nepal also has a vast potential to generate hydropower for export .   Nepal 's foreign relations expanded after the Anglo-Nepal Treaty of 1923 , which was recognised by the League of Nations . After a Soviet veto in 1949 , Nepal was admitted to the United Nations in 1955 . Friendship treaties were signed with the Dominion of India in 1950 and the People 's Republic of China in 1960 . Nepal hosts the permanent secretariat of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation ( SAARC ) , of which it is a founding member . Nepal is also a member of the Non Aligned Movement and the Bay of Bengal Initiative .

It depicts a dystopian future in which reality as perceived by most humans is actually a simulated reality called `` the Matrix '' , created by sentient machines to subdue the human population , while their bodies ' heat and electrical activity are used as an energy source . Computer programmer `` Neo '' learns this truth and is drawn into a rebellion against the machines , which involves other people who have been freed from the `` dream world . ''   The Matrix is known for popularizing a visual effect known as `` bullet time '' , in which the heightened perception of certain characters is represented by allowing the action within a shot to progress in slow-motion while the camera 's viewpoint appears to move through the scene at normal speed . The film is an example of the cyberpunk science fiction genre . It contains numerous references to philosophical and religious ideas , and prominently pays homage to works such as Plato 's Allegory of the Cave , Jean Baudrillard 's Simulacra and Simulation and Lewis Carroll 's Alice 's Adventures in Wonderland . The Wachowskis ' approach to action scenes drew upon their admiration for Japanese animation and martial arts films , and the film 's use of fight choreographers and wire fu techniques from Hong Kong action cinema influenced subsequent Hollywood action film productions .   The Matrix was first released in the United States on , 1999 , and grossed over $ 460 million worldwide . It was generally well-received by critics and won four Academy Awards , as well as other accolades , including BAFTA Awards and Saturn Awards . Reviewers praised The Matrix for its innovative visual effects , cinematography and entertainment value . The film 's premise was both criticized for being derivative of earlier science fiction works and praised for being intriguing . The action also polarized critics , some describing it as impressive , but others dismissing it as a trite distraction from an interesting premise .   The film has since appeared in lists of the greatest science fiction films , and , in 2012 , was added to the National Film Registry for preservation . The success of the film led to the release of two feature film sequels , both written and directed by the Wachowskis : The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions . The Matrix franchise was further expanded through the production of comic books , video games and animated short films , in which the Wachowskis were heavily involved .", "metadata": {}}

Istanbul is a transcontinental city in Eurasia , straddling the Bosphorus strait ( which separates Europe and Asia ) between the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea . Its commercial and historical center lies on the European side and about a third of its population lives on the Asian side .  The city is the administrative center of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality ( conterminous with Istanbul Province ) , both hosting a population of around 14.7 million residents . Istanbul is one of the world 's most populous cities and ranks as the world 's 7th-largest city proper and the largest European city .   Founded under the name of Byzantion on the Sarayburnu promontory around 660 BCE , the city developed to become one of the most significant in history . After its reestablishment as Constantinople in 330 CE , it served as an imperial capital for almost 16 centuries , during the Roman and Byzantine ( 330 -- 1204 and 1261 -- 1453 ) , the Latin ( 1204 -- 1261 ) , and the Ottoman ( 1453 -- 1922 ) empires . It was instrumental in the advancement of Christianity during Roman and Byzantine times , before the Ottomans conquered the city in 1453 and transformed it into an Islamic stronghold and the seat of the Ottoman Caliphate .   Istanbul 's strategic position on the historic Silk Road , rail networks to Europe and the Middle East , and the only sea route between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean have produced a cosmopolitan populace , although less so since the establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1923 . Overlooked for the new capital Ankara during the interwar period , the city has since regained much of its prominence . The population of the city has increased tenfold since the 1950s , as migrants from across Anatolia have moved in and city limits have expanded to accommodate them . Arts , music , film , and cultural festivals were established at the end of the 20th century and continue to be hosted by the city today . Infrastructure improvements have produced a complex transportation network .   Approximately foreign visitors arrived in Istanbul in 2015 , five years after it was named a European Capital of Culture , making the city the world 's fifth most popular tourist destination . The city 's biggest attraction is its historic center , partially listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site , and its cultural and entertainment hub can be found across the city 's natural harbor , the Golden Horn , in the Beyo\u011flu district . Considered a global city , Istanbul has one of the fastest-growing metropolitan economies in the world . It hosts the headquarters of many Turkish companies and media outlets and accounts for more than a quarter of the country 's gross domestic product . Hoping to capitalize on its revitalization and rapid expansion , Istanbul has bid for the Summer Olympics five times in twenty years .", "metadata": {}}

The FIA Formula One World Championship has been the premier form of racing since the inaugural season in 1950 , although other Formula One races were regularly held until 1983 . The `` formula '' , designated in the name , refers to a set of rules , to which all participants ' cars must conform . The F1 season consists of a series of races , known as Grands Prix ( from French , meaning grand prizes ) , held worldwide on purpose-built F1 circuits and public roads .   The results of each race are evaluated using a points system to determine two annual World Championships , one for drivers , one for constructors . The racing drivers are required to be holders of valid Super Licences , the highest class of racing licence issued by the FIA . The races are required to be held on tracks graded 1 ( formerly A ) , the highest grade a track can receive by the FIA . Most events are held in rural locations on purpose-built tracks , but there are several events in city centres throughout the world , with the Monaco Grand Prix being the most famous example .   Formula One cars are the fastest road course racing cars in the world , owing to very high cornering speeds achieved through the generation of large amounts of aerodynamic downforce . Formula One cars race at speeds of up to approximately 375 km/h with engines currently limited in performance to a maximum of 15,000 rpm . The cars are capable of lateral acceleration in excess of six g in corners . The performance of the cars is very dependent on electronicsalthough traction control and other driving aids have been banned since 2008and on aerodynamics , suspension , and tyres . The formula has radically evolved and changed through the history of the sport .   While Europe is the sport 's traditional base , and hosts about half of each year 's races , the sport 's scope has expanded significantly and an increasing number of Grands Prix are held on other continents . F1 had a total global television audience of 425 million people during the course of the 2014 season . Grand Prix racing began in 1906 and became the most popular type internationally in the second half of the twentieth century . The Formula One Group is the legal holder of the commercial rights .   With the cost of designing and building mid-tier cars being of the order of $ 120 million , Formula One 's economic effect and creation of jobs are significant , and its financial and political battles are widely reported . Its high profile and popularity have created a major merchandising environment , which has resulted in great investments from sponsors and budgets in the hundreds of millions for the constructors . Since 2000 the sport 's spiralling expenditures and the distribution of prize money favouring established top teams have forced complaints from smaller teams and led several teams to bankruptcy .   On 8 September 2016 it was announced that Liberty Media Corp. had agreed to buy Delta Topco , the company that controls Formula One , from private equity firm CVC Capital Partners for $ 4.4 billion in cash , stock and convertible debt .

One of the three Baltic states , it is situated along the southeastern shore of the Baltic Sea , to the east of Sweden and Denmark . It is bordered by Latvia to the north , Belarus to the east and south , Poland to the south , and Kaliningrad Oblast ( a Russian exclave ) to the southwest . Lithuania has an estimated population of 2.8 million people , and its capital and largest city is Vilnius . Lithuanians are a Baltic people . The official language , Lithuanian , along with Latvian , is one of only two living languages in the Baltic branch of the Indo-European language family .   For centuries , the southeastern shores of the Baltic Sea were inhabited by various Baltic tribes . In the 1230s , the Lithuanian lands were united by Mindaugas , the King of Lithuania , and the first unified Lithuanian state , the Kingdom of Lithuania , was created on 6 July 1253 . During the 14th century , the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was the largest country in Europe ; present-day Lithuania , Belarus , Ukraine , and parts of Poland and Russia were the territories of the Grand Duchy . With the Lublin Union of 1569 , Lithuania and Poland formed a voluntary two-state union , the Polish -- Lithuanian Commonwealth . The Commonwealth lasted more than two centuries , until neighboring countries systematically dismantled it from 1772 -- 95 , with the Russian Empire annexing most of Lithuania 's territory .   As World War I neared its end , Lithuania 's Act of Independence was signed on 16 February 1918 , declaring the founding of the modern Republic of Lithuania . In the midst of the Second World War , Lithuania was first occupied by the Soviet Union and then by Nazi Germany . As World War II neared its end and the Germans retreated , the Soviet Union reoccupied Lithuania . On 11 March 1990 , a year before the formal dissolution of the Soviet Union , Lithuania became the first Soviet republic to declare itself independent , resulting in the restoration of an independent State of Lithuania .   Lithuania is a member of the European Union , the Council of Europe , a full member of the Eurozone , Schengen Agreement and NATO . It is also a member of the Nordic Investment Bank , and part of Nordic-Baltic cooperation of Northern European countries .

{"pid": "Doctor_Who", "title_text": "Doctor Who", "passage_text": "Doctor Who is a British science-fiction television programme produced by the BBC since 1963 . The programme depicts the adventures of a Time Lord called `` The Doctor '' , an extraterrestrial being from the planet Gallifrey . He explores the universe in a time-travelling space ship called the TARDIS . Its exterior appears as a blue British police box , which was a common sight in Britain in 1963 when the series first aired . Accompanied by a number of companions , the Doctor combats a variety of foes , while working to save civilisations and help people in need .   The show is a significant part of British popular culture , and elsewhere it has gained a cult following . It has influenced generations of British television professionals , many of whom grew up watching the series . The programme originally ran from 1963 to 1989 . There was an unsuccessful attempt to revive regular production in 1996 with a backdoor pilot , in the form of a television film titled Doctor Who . The programme was relaunched in 2005 , and since then has been produced in-house by BBC Wales in Cardiff . Doctor Who has also spawned numerous spin-offs , including comic books , films , novels , audio dramas , and the television series Torchwood ( 2006 -- 2011 ) , The Sarah Jane Adventures ( 2007 -- 2011 ) , K-9 ( 2009 -- 2010 ) , and Class '' ( 2016-present ) , and has been the subject of many parodies and references in popular culture .   Twelve actors have headlined the series as the Doctor . The transition from one actor to another is written into the plot of the show with the concept of regeneration into a new incarnation -- an idea introduced in 1966 to allow the show to continue after the departure of original lead William Hartnell who was becoming very ill at the time . The concept is that this is a Time Lord trait through which the character of the Doctor takes on a new body and personality to recover from a severe injury or anything that would otherwise kill a normal person . Each actor 's portrayal differs , but all represent stages in the life of the same character and form a single narrative . The time-travelling feature of the plot means that different incarnations of the Doctor occasionally meet . The current lead , Peter Capaldi , took on the role after Matt Smith 's exit in the 2013 Christmas special `` The Time of the Doctor '' . In 2017 , Capaldi confirmed he would be leaving at the end of the tenth series , with his final appearance being the 2017 Christmas Special .", "metadata": {}}

These white blood cells are not fully developed and are called blasts or leukemia cells . Symptoms may include bleeding and bruising problems , feeling tired , fever , and an increased risk of infections . These symptoms occur due to a lack of normal blood cells . Diagnosis is typically made by blood tests or bone marrow biopsy .   The exact cause of leukemia is unknown . Different kinds of leukemia are believed to have different causes . Both inherited and environmental ( non-inherited ) factors are believed to be involved . Risk factors include smoking , ionizing radiation , some chemicals ( such as benzene ) , prior chemotherapy , and Down syndrome . People with a family history of leukemia are also at higher risk . There are four main types of leukemia -- acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) , acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) and chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) -- as well as a number of less common types . Leukemias and lymphomas both belong to a broader group of tumors that affect the blood , bone marrow , and lymphoid system , known as tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues .   Treatment may involve some combination of chemotherapy , radiation therapy , targeted therapy , and bone marrow transplant , in addition to supportive care and palliative care as needed . Certain types of leukemia may be managed with watchful waiting . The success of treatment depends on the type of leukemia and the age of the person . Outcomes have improved in the developed world . The average five-year survival rate is 57 % in the United States . In children under 15 , the five-year survival rate is greater than 60 to 85 % , depending on the type of leukemia . In children with acute leukemia who are cancer-free after five years , the cancer is unlikely to return .   In 2015 , leukemia was present in 2.3 million people and caused 353,500 deaths . In 2012 it newly developed in 352,000 people . It is the most common type of cancer in children , with three quarters of leukemia cases in children being the acute lymphoblastic type .

Harrison originally gave the song to his fellow Apple Records artist Billy Preston to record ; this version , which Harrison co-produced , appeared on Preston 's Encouraging Words album in September 1970 .   Harrison wrote `` My Sweet Lord '' in praise of the Hindu god Krishna , while at the same time intending the lyrics to serve as a call to abandon religious sectarianism through his deliberate blending of the Hebrew word hallelujah with chants of `` Hare Krishna '' and Vedic prayer . The recording features producer Phil Spector 's Wall of Sound treatment and heralded the arrival of Harrison 's much-admired slide guitar technique , which one biographer described as being `` musically as distinctive a signature as the mark of Zorro '' . Preston , Ringo Starr , Eric Clapton , and the group Badfinger are among the other musicians appearing on the recording .   Later in the 1970s , `` My Sweet Lord '' was at the centre of a heavily publicised copyright infringement suit , due to its similarity to the Ronnie Mack song `` He 's So Fine '' , a 1963 hit for the New York girl group the Chiffons . In 1976 , Harrison was found to have subconsciously plagiarised the earlier tune , a verdict that had repercussions throughout the music industry . He claimed to have used the out-of-copyright `` Oh Happy Day '' , a Christian hymn , as his inspiration for the song 's melody .   Harrison performed `` My Sweet Lord '' at the Concert for Bangladesh in August 1971 , and it remains the most popular composition from his post-Beatles career . He reworked the song as `` My Sweet Lord ( 2000 ) '' for inclusion as a bonus track on the 30th anniversary reissue of All Things Must Pass . Many artists have covered the song including Andy Williams , Peggy Lee , Edwin Starr , Johnny Mathis , Nina Simone , Julio Iglesias , Richie Havens , Megadeth , Boy George , Elton John , Jim James , Bonnie Bramlett and Elliott Smith . `` My Sweet Lord '' is ranked 460th on Rolling Stone magazine 's list of `` the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time '' . The song reached number 1 in Britain for a second time when re-released in January 2002 , two months after Harrison 's death .", "metadata": {}}

One of the key bands in the grunge movement of the early 1990s , over the course of the band 's career , its members became noted for their refusal to adhere to traditional music industry practices , including refusing to make proper music videos or give interviews , and engaging in a much-publicized boycott of Ticketmaster . In 2006 , Rolling Stone described the band as having `` spent much of the past decade deliberately tearing apart their own fame . ''   To date , the band has sold nearly 32million records in the United States and an estimated 60million worldwide . Pearl Jam has outlasted and outsold many of its contemporaries from the alternative rock breakthrough of the early 1990s , and is considered one of the most influential bands of that decade . Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic referred to Pearl Jam as `` the most popular American rock & roll band of the '90s '' . Pearl Jam were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on April 7 , 2017 , in their first year of eligibility .", "metadata": {}}

The term is particularly ( and originally ) used to describe the use of this formation in Ancient Greek warfare , although the ancient Greek writers used it to also describe any massed infantry formation , regardless of its equipment , as does Arrian in his Array against the Alans when he refers to his legions . In Greek texts , the phalanx may be deployed for battle , on the march , even camped , thus describing the mass of infantry or cavalry that would deploy in line during battle . They marched forward as one entity . The word phalanx is derived from the Greek word phalangos , meaning finger .   The term itself , as used today , does not refer to a distinctive military unit or division ( e.g. , the Roman legion or the contemporary Western-type battalion ) , but to the general formation of an army 's troops . Thus a phalanx does not have a standard combat strength or composition but includes the total number of infantry , which is or will be deployed in action in a single phalanx formation .   Many spear-armed troops historically fought in what might be termed phalanx-like formations . The word has come into use in common English to describe `` a group of people standing , or moving forward closely together '' ; c.f. `` a phalanx of police '' .   This article focuses on the use of the military phalanx formation in Ancient Greece , the Hellenistic world , and other ancient states heavily influenced by Greek civilization .", "metadata": {}}

Mary was -- excluding the disputed reigns of Jane and the Empress Matilda -- the first queen regnant of England . In 1554 , Mary married Philip of Spain , becoming queen consort of Habsburg Spain on his accession in 1556 .   Mary is remembered for her restoration of Roman Catholicism after her half-brother 's short-lived Protestant reign .

{"pid": "Peripheral_artery_disease", "title_text": "Peripheral artery disease", "passage_text": "Peripheral artery disease ( PAD ) is a narrowing of the arteries other than those that supply the heart or the brain . When narrowing occurs in the heart , it is called coronary artery disease , while , in the brain , it is called cerebrovascular disease . Peripheral artery disease most commonly affects the legs , but other arteries may also be involved . The classic symptom is leg pain when walking which resolves with rest , known as intermittent claudication . Other symptoms including skin ulcers , bluish skin , cold skin , or poor nail and hair growth may occur in the affected leg . Complications may include an infection or tissue death which may require amputation ; coronary artery disease , or stroke . Up to 50 % of cases of PAD are without symptoms .   The main risk factor is cigarette smoking . Other risk factors include diabetes , high blood pressure , and high blood cholesterol . The underlying mechanism is usually atherosclerosis . Other causes include artery spasm . PAD is typically diagnosed by finding an ankle-brachial index ( ABI ) less than 0.90 , which is the systolic blood pressure at the ankle divided by the systolic blood pressure of the arm . Duplex ultrasonography and angiography may also be used . Angiography is more accurate and allows for treatment at the same time ; however , it is associated with greater risks .   It is unclear if screening for disease is useful as it has not been properly studied . In those with intermittent claudication from PAD , stopping smoking and supervised exercise therapy improves outcomes . Medications , including statins , ACE inhibitors , and cilostazol also may help . Aspirin does not appear to help those with mild disease but is usually recommended in those with more significant disease . Anticoagulants such as warfarin are not typically of benefit . Procedures used to treat the disease include bypass grafting , angioplasty , and atherectomy .   In 2015 about 155 million people had PAD worldwide . In the developed world it affects about 5.3 % of 45 to 50 years olds and 18.6 % of 85 - to 90-year-olds . In the developing world it affects 4.6 % of people between the ages of 45 to 50 and 15 % of people between the ages of 85 to 90 . In the developed world PAD is equally common among men and women while in the developing world women are more commonly affected . In 2015 PAD resulted in about 52,500 deaths up from 16,000 deaths in 1990 .", "metadata": {}}

Dedicated to honoring country music and its history , the Opry showcases a mix of famous singers and contemporary chart-toppers performing country , bluegrass , folk , gospel , and comedic performances and skits . It attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors from around the world and millions of radio and Internet listeners .   The Opry 's current primary slogan is `` The Show that Made Country Music Famous '' . Other slogans include `` Home of American Music '' and `` Country 's Most Famous Stage '' .   In the 1930s the show began hiring professionals and expanded to four hours ; and WSM , broadcasting by then with 50,000 watts , made the program a Saturday night musical tradition in nearly 30 states . In 1939 , it debuted nationally on NBC Radio . The Opry moved to a permanent home , the Ryman Auditorium , in 1943 . As it developed in importance , so did the city of Nashville , which became America 's `` country music capital '' . The Grand Ole Opry holds such significance in Nashville that its name is included on the city/county line signs on all major roadways . The signs read `` Music City | Metropolitan Nashville Davidson County | Home of the Grand Ole Opry '' .   Membership in the Opry remains one of country music 's crowning achievements .

{"pid": "Stanley_Kubrick", "title_text": "Stanley Kubrick", "passage_text": "Stanley Kubrick ( -LSB- \u02c8ku\u02d0br\u026ak -RSB- July 26 , 1928 -- March 7 , 1999 ) was an American film director , screenwriter , producer , cinematographer , editor , and photographer . He is frequently cited as one of the greatest and most influential directors in cinematic history . His films , which are mostly adaptations of novels or short stories , cover a wide range of genres , and are noted for their realism , dark humor , unique cinematography , extensive set designs , and evocative use of music .   Kubrick was born and raised in the Bronx , New York City , and attended William Howard Taft High School from 1941 to 1945 . Although he only received average grades , Kubrick displayed a keen interest in literature , photography , and film from a young age , and taught himself all aspects of film production and directing after graduating from high school . After working as a photographer for Look magazine in the late 1940s and early 1950s , he began making short films on a shoestring budget , and made his first major Hollywood film , The Killing , for United Artists in 1956 . This was followed by two collaborations with Kirk Douglas , the war picture Paths of Glory ( 1957 ) and the historical epic Spartacus ( 1960 ) . His reputation as a filmmaker in Hollywood grew , and he was approached by Marlon Brando to film what would become One-Eyed Jacks ( 1961 ) , though Brando eventually decided to direct it himself .   Creative differences arising from his work with Douglas and the film studios , a dislike of Hollywood , and a growing concern about crime in America prompted Kubrick to move to the United Kingdom in 1961 , where he spent most of the remainder of his life and career . His home at Childwickbury Manor in Hertfordshire , which he shared with his wife Christiane , became his workplace , where he did his writing , research , editing , and management of production details . This allowed him to have almost complete artistic control over his films , but with the rare advantage of having financial support from major Hollywood studios . His first British productions were two films with Peter Sellers , Lolita ( 1962 ) and Dr. Strangelove ( 1964 ) .   A demanding perfectionist , Kubrick assumed control over most aspects of the filmmaking process , from direction and writing to editing , and took painstaking care with researching his films and staging scenes , working in close coordination with his actors and other collaborators . He often asked for several dozen retakes of the same scene in a movie , which resulted in many conflicts with his casts . Despite the resulting notoriety among actors , many of Kubrick 's films broke new ground in cinematography . The scientific realism and innovative special effects of 2001 : A Space Odyssey ( 1968 ) were without precedent in the history of cinema , and the film earned him his only personal Oscar , for Best Visual Effects . Steven Spielberg has referred to the film as his generation 's `` big bang '' , and it is regarded as one of the greatest films ever made . For the 18th-century period film Barry Lyndon ( 1975 ) , Kubrick obtained lenses developed by Zeiss for NASA , to film scenes under natural candlelight . With The Shining ( 1980 ) , he became one of the first directors to make use of a Steadicam for stabilized and fluid tracking shots . While many of Kubrick 's films were controversial and initially received mixed reviews upon release -- particularly A Clockwork Orange ( 1971 ) , which Kubrick pulled from circulation in the UK following a mass media frenzy -- most were nominated for Oscars , Golden Globes , or BAFTA Awards , and underwent critical reevaluations . His last film , Eyes Wide Shut , was completed shortly before his death in 1999 at the age of 70 .", "metadata": {}}

The Czech Republic covers an area of 78866 km2 with a mostly temperate continental climate and oceanic climate . It is a unitary parliamentary republic , has 10.5 million inhabitants and the capital and largest city is Prague , with over 1.2 million residents . The Czech Republic includes the historical territories of Bohemia , Moravia , and Czech Silesia .   The Czech state was formed in the late 9th century as the Duchy of Bohemia under the Great Moravian Empire . After the fall of the Empire in 907 , the centre of power transferred from Moravia to Bohemia under the P\u0159emyslid dynasty . In 1002 , the duchy was formally recognized as part of the Holy Roman Empire , becoming the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1198 and reaching its greatest territorial extent in the 14th century . Besides Bohemia itself , the king of Bohemia ruled the lands of the Bohemian Crown , he had a vote in the election of the Holy Roman Emperor , and Prague was the imperial seat in periods between the 14th and 17th century . In the Hussite wars of the 15th century driven by the Protestant Bohemian Reformation , the kingdom faced economic embargoes and defeated five consecutive crusades proclaimed by the leaders of the Roman Catholic Church .   Following the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1526 , the whole Crown of Bohemia was gradually integrated into the Habsburg Monarchy alongside the Archduchy of Austria and the Kingdom of Hungary . The Protestant Bohemian Revolt ( 1618 -- 20 ) against the Catholic Habsburgs led to the Thirty Years ' War . After the Battle of the White Mountain , the Habsburgs consolidated their rule , eradicated Protestantism and reimposed Roman Catholicism , and also adopted a policy of gradual Germanization . With the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 , the Bohemian Kingdom became part of the Austrian Empire and the Czech language experienced a revival as a consequence of widespread romantic nationalism . In the 19th century , the Czech lands became the industrial powerhouse of the monarchy and were subsequently the core of the Republic of Czechoslovakia , which was formed in 1918 following the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after World War I.   The Czech part of Czechoslovakia was occupied by Germany in World War II , and was liberated in 1945 by the armies of the Soviet Union and the United States . The Czech country lost the majority of its German-speaking inhabitants after they were expelled following the war . The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia won the 1946 elections . Following the 1948 coup d'\u00e9tat , Czechoslovakia became a one-party communist state under Soviet influence . In 1968 , increasing dissatisfaction with the regime culminated in a reform movement known as the Prague Spring , which ended in a Soviet-led invasion .   The first separate Czech republic was created on 1 January 1969 , under the name Czech Socialistic Republic within federalization of Czechoslovakia , however the federalization was implemented only incompletely . Czechoslovakia remained occupied until the 1989 Velvet Revolution , when the communist regime collapsed and a democracy and federalization was deepened . On 6 March 1990 , the Czech Socialistic Republic was renamed to the Czech Republic . On 1 January 1993 , Czechoslovakia peacefully dissolved , with its constituent states becoming the independent states of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic .   The Czech Republic joined NATO in 1999 and the European Union ( EU ) in 2004 ; it is a member of the United Nations , the OECD , the OSCE , and the Council of Europe . It is a developed country with an advanced , high income economy and high living standards . The UNDP ranks the country 14th in inequality-adjusted human development . In 2017 , Czech citizens had visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 168 countries and territories , ranking the Czech passport 9th in the world ( after 25 other countries ) . The Czech Republic also ranks as the 6th most peaceful country , while achieving strong performance in democratic governance . It has the lowest unemployment rate of EU members .", "metadata": {}}

Goyer . Featuring the DC Comics character Batman , the film is the final installment in Nolan 's Batman film trilogy , and the sequel to Batman Begins ( 2005 ) and The Dark Knight ( 2008 ) . Christian Bale reprises the lead role of Bruce Wayne/Batman , with a returning cast of allies : Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth , Gary Oldman as James Gordon , and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox . The film introduces Selina Kyle ( Anne Hathaway ) , and Bane ( Tom Hardy ) . Eight years after the events of The Dark Knight , merciless revolutionary Bane forces an older Bruce Wayne to resume his role as Batman and save Gotham City from nuclear destruction .   Christopher Nolan was hesitant about returning to the series for a second time , but agreed after developing a story with his brother and Goyer that he felt would conclude the series on a satisfactory note . Nolan drew inspiration from Bane 's comic book debut in the 1993 `` Knightfall '' storyline , the 1986 series The Dark Knight Returns , and the 1999 storyline `` No Man 's Land '' . Filming took place in locations including Jodhpur , London , Nottingham , Glasgow , Los Angeles , New York City , Newark , and Pittsburgh . Nolan used IMAX 70 mm film cameras for much of the filming , including the first six minutes of the film , to optimize the quality of the picture . A vehicle variation of the Batplane and Batcopter termed the `` Bat '' , an underground prison set , and a new Batcave set were created specifically for the film . As with The Dark Knight , viral marketing campaigns began early during production . When filming concluded , Warner Bros. refocused its campaign : developing promotional websites , releasing the first six minutes of the film , screening theatrical trailers , and sending out information regarding the film 's plot .   The Dark Knight Rises premiered in New York City on July 16 , 2012 . The film was released in the United States and the United Kingdom on July 20 , 2012 . It received positive reviews from critics , many of whom named it one of the best films of 2012 . Like its predecessor , the film grossed over $ 1 billion worldwide at the box office , making it the second film in the Batman film series to earn $ 1 billion . It is currently the 17th-highest-grossing film of all time , the third-highest-grossing film of 2012 , and the fourth-highest-grossing superhero film of all time .", "metadata": {}}

Glaciers slowly deform and flow due to stresses induced by their weight , creating crevasses , seracs , and other distinguishing features . They also abrade rock and debris from their substrate to create landforms such as cirques and moraines . Glaciers form only on land and are distinct from the much thinner sea ice and lake ice that form on the surface of bodies of water .   On Earth , 99 % of glacial ice is contained within vast ice sheets in the polar regions , but glaciers may be found in mountain ranges on every continent except Australia , and on a few high-latitude oceanic islands . Between 35 \u00b0 N and 35 \u00b0 S , glaciers occur only in the Himalayas , Andes , Rocky Mountains , a few high mountains in East Africa , Mexico , New Guinea and on Zard Kuh in Iran . Glaciers cover about 10 percent of Earth 's land surface . Continental glaciers cover nearly 5 e6sqmi or about 98 percent of Antarctica 's 5.1 e6sqmi , with an average thickness of 7,000 ft. Greenland and Patagonia also have huge expanses of continental glaciers .   Glacial ice is the largest reservoir of fresh water on Earth . Many glaciers from temperate , alpine and seasonal polar climates store water as ice during the colder seasons and release it later in the form of meltwater as warmer summer temperatures cause the glacier to melt , creating a water source that is especially important for plants , animals and human uses when other sources may be scant . Within high altitude and Antarctic environments , the seasonal temperature difference is often not sufficient to release meltwater .   Because glacial mass is affected by long-term climatic changes , e.g. , precipitation , mean temperature , and cloud cover , glacial mass changes are considered among the most sensitive indicators of climate change and are a major source of variations in sea level .   A large piece of compressed ice , or a glacier , appears blue as large quantities of water appear blue . This is because water molecules absorb other colors more efficiently than blue . The other reason for the blue color of glaciers is the lack of air bubbles . Air bubbles , which give a white color to ice , are squeezed out by pressure increasing the density of the created ice .", "metadata": {}}

Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean , covering 9.98 e6km2 , making it the world 's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area . Canada 's border with the United States is the world 's longest binational land border . The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate , but southerly areas are warm in summer . Canada is sparsely populated , the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains . It is highly urbanized with 82 per cent of the 35.15 million people concentrated in large and medium-sized cities , many near the southern border . One third of the population lives in the three largest cities : Toronto , Montreal and Vancouver . Its capital is Ottawa , and other major urban areas include Calgary , Edmonton , Quebec City , Winnipeg and Hamilton .   Various aboriginal peoples had inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years prior to European colonization . Beginning in the 16th century , British and French claims were made on the area , with the colony of Canada first being established by the French in 1535 during Jacques Cartier 's second voyage to New France . As a consequence of various conflicts , Great Britain gained and lost territories within British North America until it was left , in the late 18th century , with what mostly geographically comprises Canada today . Pursuant to the British North America Act , on July 1 , 1867 , the colonies of Canada , New Brunswick , and Nova Scotia joined to form the semi-autonomous federal Dominion of Canada . This began an accretion of provinces and territories to the mostly self-governing Dominion to the present ten provinces and three territories forming modern Canada .   In 1931 , Canada achieved near total independence from the United Kingdom with the Statute of Westminster 1931 , but at the time , Canada decided to allow the British Parliament to temporarily retain the power to amend Canada 's constitution , on request from the Parliament of Canada . With the Constitution Act 1982 , Canada took over that authority ( as the conclusion of Patriation ) , removing the last remaining ties of legal dependence on the Parliament of the United Kingdom , giving the country full sovereignty .   Canada is a federal parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy , with Queen Elizabeth II being the head of state . The country is officially bilingual at the federal level . It is one of the world 's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations , the product of large-scale immigration from many other countries . Its advanced economy is the eleventh largest in the world , relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks . Canada 's long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its economy and culture .   Canada is a developed country and has the tenth highest nominal per capita income globally as well as the ninth highest ranking in the Human Development Index . It ranks among the highest in international measurements of government transparency , civil liberties , quality of life , economic freedom , and education . Canada is a Commonwealth realm member of the Commonwealth of Nations , a member of the Francophonie , and part of several major international and intergovernmental institutions or groupings including the United Nations , the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , the G8 , the Group of Ten , the G20 , the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum .", "metadata": {}}

The capital city is Lusaka , in the south-central part of Zambia . The population is concentrated mainly around Lusaka in the south and the Copperbelt Province to the northwest , the core economic hubs of the country .   Originally inhabited by Khoisan peoples , the region was affected by the Bantu expansion of the thirteenth century . After visits by European explorers in the eighteenth century , Zambia became the British protectorate of Northern Rhodesia towards the end of the nineteenth century . For most of the colonial period , Zambia was governed by an administration appointed from London with the advice of the British South Africa Company .   On 24 October 1964 , Zambia became independent of the United Kingdom and prime minister Kenneth Kaunda became the inaugural president . Kaunda 's socialist United National Independence Party ( UNIP ) maintained power from 1964 until 1991 . Kaunda played a key role in regional diplomacy , cooperating closely with the United States in search of solutions to conflicts in Rhodesia ( Zimbabwe ) , Angola , and Namibia . From 1972 to 1991 Zambia was a one-party state with the UNIP as the sole legal political party under the motto `` One Zambia , One Nation '' . Kaunda was succeeded by Frederick Chiluba of the social-democratic Movement for Multi-Party Democracy in 1991 , beginning a period of social-economic growth and government decentralisation . Levy Mwanawasa , Chiluba 's chosen successor , presided over Zambia from January 2002 until his death in August 2008 , and is credited with campaigns to reduce corruption and increase the standard of living . After Mwanawasa 's death , Rupiah Banda presided as Acting President before being elected President in 2008 . Holding office for only three years , Banda stepped down after his defeat in the 2011 elections by Patriotic Front party leader Michael Sata . Sata died on 28 October 2014 , the second Zambian president to die in office . Guy Scott served briefly as interim president until new elections were held on 20 January 2015 , in which Edgar Lungu was elected as the sixth President .

It is bordered by Guinea to the north-east , Liberia to the south-east , and the Atlantic Ocean to the south-west . Sierra Leone has a tropical climate , with a diverse environment ranging from savannah to rainforests . Sierra Leone has a total area of 71740 km2 and a population of 7,075,641 ( based on 2015 national census ) .   Sierra Leone is officially made up of four administrative regions : the Northern Province , Eastern Province , Southern Province and the Western Area , which are subdivided into fourteen districts . Each district has its own elected local government .   Freetown ( population 1,050,301 ) , located in the Western Area , is the capital , largest city and its economic and political centre . Bo ( population 306,000 ) , is the second largest city , and is located in the Southern Province , about 160 miles from Freetown .

Makeni ( population 126,058 ) , located in the Northern Province , is the fifth largest of Sierra Leone 's five major cities , and is about 85 miles from Freetown .   Sierra Leone is a constitutional republic with a directly elected president and a unicameral legislature . Sierra Leone became an independent Nation on 27 April 1961 from Britain , led by Sir Milton Margai , who was elected by landslide as the first prime minister of the new nation under parliamentary government .   The current constitution of Sierra Leone was adopted in 1991 during the presidency of Joseph Saidu Momoh , though it has been amended several times . Since independence to present , Sierra Leone politics has been dominated by two major political parties ; the Sierra Leone People 's party ( SLPP ) and the All People 's Congress ( APC ) . The current president of SIerra Leone is Ernest Bai Koroma , a member of the APC party , who was elected in 2007 after defeating the ruling SLPP candidate , and he won reelection for his final term as president in 2012 .   From 1991 to 2002 , the Sierra Leone civil war was fought and devastated the country . This proxy war left more than 50,000 people dead , much of the country 's infrastructure destroyed , and over two million people displaced as refugees in neighbouring countries . In January 2002 , then Sierra Leone 's president Ahmad Tejan Kabbah , fulfilled his campaign promise by ending the civil war , with help by the British Government , ECOWAS and the United Nations .   More recently , the 2014 Ebola outbreak overburdened the weak healthcare infrastructure , leading to more deaths from medical neglect than Ebola itself . It created a humanitarian crisis situation and a negative spiral of weaker economic growth . The country has an extremely low life expectancy at 57.8 years .   About sixteen ethnic groups inhabit Sierra Leone , each with its own language and customs . The two largest and most influential are the Temne and the Mende people . The Temne are predominantly found in the north of the country , while the Mende are predominant in the south-east . Sierra Leone has a significant minority of the Krio people , who are descendants of freed African American and West Indian slaves .   Although English is the official language spoken at schools and government administration , the Krio language is the most widely spoken language across Sierra Leone and is spoken by 97 % of the country 's population . The Krio language unites all the different ethnic groups in the country , especially in their trade and social interaction with each other .   Sierra Leone is a predominantly secular Muslim majority country , with the overall muslim population at 77 % of the population , though with an influential Christian minority at about 22 % . Sierra Leone is regarded as one of the most religiously tolerant nations in the world . Muslims and Christians collaborate and interact with each other very peacefully . Religious violence is very rare in the country . The major Christian and Muslim holidays are officially national holidays including Christmas and Eid Al Fitr . In politics , the overwhelming majority of Sierra Leoneans vote for a candidate without regard to whether the candidate is a Muslim or a Christian .   Sierra Leone has relied on mining , especially diamonds , for its economic base . It is also among the largest producers of titanium and bauxite , a major producer of gold , and has one of the world 's largest deposits of rutile . Sierra Leone is home to the third-largest natural harbour in the world . Despite exploitation of this natural wealth , 70 % of its people live in poverty .   Sierra Leone is a member of many international organisations , including the United Nations , the African Union , the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) , the Mano River Union , the Commonwealth of Nations , the African Development Bank , and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation .", "metadata": {}}

Hawaii is the only U.S. state located in Oceania and the only one composed entirely of islands . It is the northernmost island group in Polynesia , occupying most of an archipelago in the central Pacific Ocean . Hawaii is the only U.S. state not located in the Americas .   The state encompasses nearly the entire volcanic Hawaiian archipelago , which comprises hundreds of islands spread over 1500 mi . At the southeastern end of the archipelago , the eight main islands are -- in order from northwest to southeast : Niihau , Kauai , Oahu , Molokai , L\u0101nai , Kahoolawe , Maui , and the Island of Hawaii . The last is the largest island in the group ; it is often called the `` Big Island '' or `` Hawaii Island '' to avoid confusion with the state or archipelago . The archipelago is physiographically and ethnologically part of the Polynesian subregion of Oceania .   Hawaii 's diverse natural scenery , warm tropical climate , abundance of public beaches , oceanic surroundings , and active volcanoes make it a popular destination for tourists , surfers , biologists , and volcanologists . Because of its central location in the Pacific and 19th-century labor migration , Hawaii 's culture is strongly influenced by North American and Asian cultures , in addition to its indigenous Hawaiian culture . Hawaii has over a million permanent residents , along with many visitors and U.S. military personnel . Its capital is Honolulu on the island of Oahu .   Hawaii is the 8th-smallest and the 11th-least populous , but the 13th-most densely populated of the fifty U.S. states . It is the only state with an Asian plurality .

He was born in Bridgeport , Connecticut , and raised in nearby Fairfield . He attended Berklee College of Music in Boston , but disenrolled and moved to Atlanta in 1997 with Clay Cook . Together , they formed a short-lived two-man band called Lo-Fi Masters . After their split , Mayer continued to play local clubs -- refining his skills and gaining a following . After his appearance at the 2001 South by Southwest Festival , he was signed to Aware Records , and then Columbia Records , which released his first EP , Inside Wants Out . His following two full-length albums -- Room for Squares ( 2001 ) and Heavier Things ( 2003 ) -- did well commercially , achieving multi-platinum status . In 2003 , he won the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for the single `` Your Body Is a Wonderland '' .   Though Mayer started his career mainly performing acoustic rock , he began moving towards the blues genre that had originally influenced him as a musician . By 2005 , he was collaborating with blues artists such as B. B. King , Buddy Guy , and Eric Clapton . Forming the John Mayer Trio , he released a live album in 2005 called Try ! , and his third studio album Continuum in 2006 . Both albums received wide critical acclaim , and Continuum earned Mayer a 2007 Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album . He also won Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for `` Waiting on the World to Change '' . That album was followed by Battle Studies in 2009 , a return to pop , with a number-one grossing tour .   After having several controversial incidents with the media , Mayer withdrew from public life in 2010 and began work on a follow-up album , called Born and Raised , that would draw inspiration from the 1970s pop music of Laurel Canyon . However , the discovery of a granuloma on his vocal cords delayed the release of the album until May 2012 , and ultimately forced him to cancel the planned tour . Even so , the album enjoyed a generally favorable reception , though was less commercially successful than his previous work . After extensive treatments for his vocal problems -- and a two-year hiatus -- Mayer began performing as a singer again in January 2013 , and that year released the album , Paradise Valley . The album is named for where he lives in Montana and features country music influences . By 2014 , he had sold a total of over 20 million albums worldwide . After developing an interest in the Grateful Dead and connecting with Bob Weir , Mayer formed Dead & Company with three former Grateful Dead musicians . After two well-received tours in the fall of 2015 and summer of 2016 , the band has already committed to another tour for the summer of 2017 .   Mayer 's secondary career pursuits extend to television hosting , comedy , and writing ; he has authored columns for magazines such as Esquire . He supports various causes and has performed at charity benefits . He is a watch aficionado ( with a collection he values in the `` tens of millions '' of dollars ) , and has been on the jury at the Grand Prix d'Horlogerie de Gen\u00e8ve .

Its coast in the south lies on the Gulf of Guinea in the Atlantic Ocean . It comprises 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory , where the capital , Abuja is located . Nigeria is officially a democratic secular country .   Modern-day Nigeria has been the site of numerous kingdoms and tribal states over the millennia . The modern state originated from British colonial rule beginning in the 19th century , and the merging of the Southern Nigeria Protectorate and Northern Nigeria Protectorate in 1914 . The British set up administrative and legal structures whilst practising indirect rule through traditional chiefdoms . Nigeria became a formally independent federation in 1960 , and plunged into a civil war from 1967 to 1970 . It has since alternated between democratically elected civilian governments and military dictatorships , until it achieved a stable democracy in 1999 , with the 2011 presidential elections considered the first to be reasonably free and fair .   Nigeria is often referred to as the `` Giant of Africa '' , owing to its large population and economy . With approximately 184 million inhabitants , Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa and the seventh most populous country in the world . Nigeria has one of the largest populations of youth in the world . The country is viewed as a multinational state , as it is inhabited by over 500 ethnic groups , of which the three largest are the Hausa , Igbo and Yoruba ; these ethnic groups speak over 500 different languages , and are identified with wide variety of cultures . The official language is English . Nigeria is divided roughly in half between Christians , who live mostly in the southern part of the country , and Muslims in the northern part . A minority of the population practise religions indigenous to Nigeria , such as those native to the Igbo and Yoruba ethnicities .   , Nigeria is the world 's 20th largest economy , worth more than $ 500 billion and $ 1 trillion in terms of nominal GDP and purchasing power parity respectively . It overtook South Africa to become Africa 's largest economy in 2014 . The 2013 debt-to-GDP ratio was 11 percent . Nigeria is considered to be an emerging market by the World Bank ; it has been identified as a regional power on the African continent , a middle power in international affairs , and has also been identified as an emerging global power . Nigeria is a member of the MINT group of countries , which are widely seen as the globe 's next `` BRIC-like '' economies . It is also listed among the `` Next Eleven '' economies set to become among the biggest in the world . Nigeria is a founding member of the African Union and a member of many other international organizations , including the United Nations , the Commonwealth of Nations and OPEC .", "metadata": {}}
{"pid": "Prussia", "title_text": "Prussia", "passage_text": "Prussia was a historical state originating out of the Duchy of Prussia and the Margraviate of Brandenburg , and centred on the region of Prussia . For centuries , the House of nocat = y ruled Prussia , successfully expanding its size by way of an unusually well-organised and effective army . Prussia , with its capital in K\u00f6nigsberg and from 1701 in Berlin , shaped the history of Germany . In 1871 , German states united to create the German Empire under Prussian leadership . In November 1918 , the monarchies were abolished and the nobility lost its political power during the German Revolution of 1918 -- 19 . The Kingdom of Prussia was thus abolished in favour of a republic -- the Free State of Prussia , a state of Germany from 1918 until 1933 . From 1933 , Prussia lost its independence as a result of the Prussian coup , when the Nazi regime was successfully establishing its Gleichschaltung laws in pursuit of a unitary state . With the end of the Nazi regime , the division of Germany into allied-occupation zones and the separation of its territories east of the -LSB- Oder -- Neisse , nocat = y -RSB- line , which were incorporated into Poland and the Soviet Union , the State of Prussia ceased to exist de facto in 1945 . Prussia existed de jure until its formal liquidation by the Allied Control Council Enactment No. 46 of 25 February 1947 .   The name Prussia derives from the Old Prussians . In the 13th century , the Teutonic Knights -- an organized Catholic medieval military order of German crusaders -- conquered the lands inhabited by them . In 1308 , the Teutonic Knights conquered the region of Pomerelia with Gda\u0144sk ( Danzig ) . Their monastic state was mostly Germanised through immigration from central and western Germany and in the south , it was Polonised by settlers from Masovia . The Second Peace of Thorn ( 1466 ) split Prussia into the western Royal Prussia , a province of Poland , and the eastern part , from 1525 called the Duchy of Prussia , a fief of the Crown of Poland up to 1657 . The union of Brandenburg and the Duchy of Prussia in 1618 led to the proclamation of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701 .   Prussia entered the ranks of the great powers shortly after becoming a kingdom , and exercised most influence in the 18th and 19th centuries . During the 18th century it had a major say in many international affairs under the reign of Frederick the Great . During the 19th century , Chancellor Otto von Bismarck united the German principalities into a `` Lesser Germany '' which excluded the Austrian Empire .   At the Congress of Vienna ( 1814 -- 15 ) , which redrew the map of Europe following Napoleon 's defeat , Prussia acquired a large section of north western Germany , including the coal-rich Ruhr . The country then grew rapidly in influence economically and politically , and became the core of the North German Confederation in 1867 , and then of the German Empire in 1871 . The Kingdom of Prussia was now so large and so dominant in the new Germany that -LSB- Junker ( Prussia ) , Junker -RSB- s and other Prussian \u00e9lites identified more and more as Germans and less as Prussians .   The Kingdom ended in 1918 . In the Weimar Republic , the state of Prussia lost nearly all of its legal and political importance following the 1932 coup led by Franz von Papen . East Prussia lost all of its German population after 1945 , as Poland and the Soviet Union absorbed its territory and expelled most of its inhabitants .   The term Prussian has often been used , especially outside of Germany , to emphasise the professionalism , aggressiveness , militarism and conservatism of the Junker class of landed aristocrats in the East who dominated first Prussia and then the German Empire .", "metadata": {}}

These deposits form a mineralized package that is of economic interest to the miner .   Ores recovered by mining include metals , coal , oil shale , gemstones , limestone , chalk , dimension stone , rock salt , potash , gravel , and clay . Mining is required to obtain any material that can not be grown through agricultural processes , or created artificially in a laboratory or factory . Mining in a wider sense includes extraction of any non-renewable resource such as petroleum , natural gas , or even water .   Mining of stones and metal has been a human activity since pre-historic times . Modern mining processes involve prospecting for ore bodies , analysis of the profit potential of a proposed mine , extraction of the desired materials , and final reclamation of the land after the mine is closed .   Mining operations usually create a negative environmental impact , both during the mining activity and after the mine has closed . Hence , most of the world 's nations have passed regulations to decrease the impact . Work safety has long been a concern as well , and modern practices have significantly improved safety in mines .   Levels of metals recycling are generally low . Unless future end-of-life recycling rates are stepped up , some rare metals may become unavailable for use in a variety of consumer products .

History of the Poona Pact  The British invited leaders of different parties in the Round Table Conferences in 1930-32 to draft a new law involving self-rule for the Indians . Mahatma Gandhi did not attend the first and the last but attended the second of the Conferences . The concept of separate electorates for the untouch was raised by Ambedkar . Similar provisions were already available for other minorities , including Muslims , Christians , Anglo-Indians and Sikhs . The British government agreed with Ambedkar 's contention and British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald 's Communal Award to the depressed classes was to be incorporated into the constitution in the governance of British India . Gandhi strongly opposed the Communal Award on the grounds that it would disintegrate Hindu society . Ambedkar vehemently criticised the way of handling the problems of the Harijans by Gandhiji . Gandhi took up a fast unto death in his prison cell in Poona , protesting that separate electorates were a device which would separate the untouchables from the Hindu society forever . He began an indefinite hunger strike at Yerwada Central Jail from 20 September 1932 to protest against this Award . A compromise was reached on 24 September 1932 .

Sometimes described as `` the father of modern linguistics '' , Chomsky is also a major figure in analytic philosophy and one of the founders of the field of cognitive science . He is Institute Professor Emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) , where he has worked since 1955 , and is the author of over 100 books on topics such as linguistics , war , politics , and mass media . Ideologically , he aligns with anarcho-syndicalism and libertarian socialism .   Born to middle-class Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants in Philadelphia , Chomsky developed an early interest in anarchism from alternative bookstores in New York City . At the age of sixteen he began studies at the University of Pennsylvania , taking courses in linguistics , mathematics , and philosophy . From 1951 to 1955 he was appointed to Harvard University 's Society of Fellows , where he developed the theory of transformational grammar for which he was awarded his doctorate in 1955 . That year he began teaching at MIT , in 1957 emerging as a significant figure in the field of linguistics for his landmark work Syntactic Structures , which remodeled the scientific study of language , while from 1958 to 1959 he was a National Science Foundation fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study . He is credited as the creator or co-creator of the universal grammar theory , the generative grammar theory , the Chomsky hierarchy , and the minimalist program . Chomsky also played a pivotal role in the decline of behaviorism , being particularly critical of the work of B. F. Skinner .   An outspoken opponent of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War , which he saw as an act of American imperialism , in 1967 Chomsky attracted widespread public attention for his anti-war essay `` The Responsibility of Intellectuals '' . Associated with the New Left , he was arrested multiple times for his activism and placed on President Richard Nixon 's Enemies List . While expanding his work in linguistics over subsequent decades , he also became involved in the Linguistics Wars . In collaboration with Edward S. Herman , Chomsky later co-wrote an analysis articulating the propaganda model of media criticism , and worked to expose the Indonesian occupation of East Timor . However , his defense of unconditional freedom of speech -- including for Holocaust deniers -- generated significant controversy in the Faurisson affair of the early 1980s . Following his retirement from active teaching , he has continued his vocal political activism , including opposing the War on Terror and supporting the Occupy movement .   One of the most cited scholars in history , Chomsky has influenced a broad array of academic fields . He is widely recognized as a paradigm shifter who helped spark a major revolution in the human sciences , contributing to the development of a new cognitivistic framework for the study of language and the mind . In addition to his continued scholarly research , he remains a leading critic of U.S. foreign policy , neoliberalism and contemporary state capitalism , the Israeli -- Palestinian conflict , and mainstream news media . His ideas have proved highly significant within the anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist movements , but have also drawn criticism , with some accusing Chomsky of anti-Americanism .", "metadata": {}}

The Greater Vancouver area had a population of 2,463,431 in 2016 , making it the third-largest metropolitan area in Canada . Vancouver has the highest population density in Canada with over 5,400 people per square kilometre . With over 250,000 residents , Vancouver is the fourth most densely populated city in North America behind New York City , San Francisco , and Mexico City according to the 2011 census . In that census , Vancouver was one of the most ethnically and linguistically diverse cities in Canada ; 52 % of its residents have a first language other than English . Vancouver is classed as a Beta global city .   Vancouver is consistently named as one of the top five worldwide cities for livability and quality of life ,  and the Economist Intelligence Unit acknowledged it as the first city ranked among the top-ten of the world 's most well-living cities  for five consecutive years .  Vancouver has hosted many international conferences and events , including the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games , UN Habitat I , Expo 86 , the World Police and Fire Games in 1989 and 2009 ; and the 2010 Winter Olympics and Paralympics which were held in Vancouver and Whistler , a resort community 125 km north of the city . In 2014 , following thirty years in California , the annual TED conference made Vancouver its indefinite home . Several matches of the 2015 FIFA Women 's World Cup were played in Vancouver , including the final at BC Place .   The original settlement , named Gastown , grew up on clearcuts on the west edge of the Hastings Mill logging sawmill 's property , where a makeshift tavern had been set up on a plank between two stumps and the proprietor , Gassy Jack , persuaded the curious millworkers to build him a tavern , on 1 July 1867 . From that first enterprise , other stores and some hotels quickly appeared along the waterfront to the west . Gastown became formally laid out as a registered townsite dubbed Granville , B.I. ( `` B.I '' standing for `` Burrard Inlet '' ) . As part of the land and political deal whereby the area of the townsite was made the railhead of the Canadian Pacific Railway ( CPR ) , it was renamed `` Vancouver '' and incorporated shortly thereafter as a city , in 1886 . By 1887 , the transcontinental railway was extended to the city to take advantage of its large natural seaport , which soon became a vital link in a trade route between the Orient , Eastern Canada , and Europe .  , Port Metro Vancouver is the third largest port by tonnage in the Americas ( displacing New York ) , 27th in the world , the busiest and largest in Canada , and the most diversified port in North America .  While forestry remains its largest industry , Vancouver is well known as an urban centre surrounded by nature , making tourism its second-largest industry .

Nepal is divided into 7 provinces and 75 districts and 744 local units including 4 metropolises , 13 sub-metropolises , 246 municipal councils and 481 villages . It has a population of 26.4 million and is the 93rd largest country by area . Bordering China in the north and India in the south , east , and west , it is the largest sovereign Himalayan state . Nepal does not border Bangladesh , which is located within only 27 km ( 17 mi ) of its southeastern tip . Neither does it border Bhutan due to the Indian state of Sikkim being located in between . Nepal has a diverse geography , including fertile plains , subalpine forested hills , and eight of the world 's ten tallest mountains , including Mount Everest , the highest point on Earth . Kathmandu is the nation 's capital and largest city . It is a multiethnic nation with Nepali as the official language .   The territory of Nepal has a recorded history since the Neolithic age . The name `` Nepal '' is first recorded in texts from the Vedic Age , the era which founded Hinduism , the predominant religion of the country . In the middle of the first millennium BCE , Gautama Buddha , the founder of Buddhism , was born in southern Nepal . Parts of northern Nepal were intertwined with the culture of Tibet . The Kathmandu Valley in central Nepal became known as Nepal proper because of its complex urban civilisation . It was the seat of the prosperous Newar confederacy known as Nepal Mandala . The Himalayan branch of the ancient Silk Road was dominated by the valley 's traders . The cosmopolitan region developed distinct traditional art and architecture . By the 18th century , the Gorkha Kingdom achieved the unification of Nepal . The Shah dynasty established the Kingdom of Nepal and later formed an alliance with the British Empire , under its Rana dynasty of premiers . The country was never colonised but served as a buffer state between Imperial China and Colonial India . In the 20th century , Nepal ended its isolation and forged strong ties with regional powers . Parliamentary democracy was introduced in 1951 , but was twice suspended by Nepalese monarchs in 1960 and 2005 . The Nepalese Civil War resulted in the proclamation of a republic in 2008 , ending the reign of the world 's last Hindu monarchy .   Modern Nepal is a federal secular parliamentary republic . It has seven states . Nepal is a developing nation , ranking 144th on the Human Development Index ( HDI ) in 2016 . The country struggles with the transition from a monarchy to a republic . It also suffers from high levels of hunger and poverty . Despite these challenges , Nepal is making steady progress , with the government declaring its commitment to elevate the nation from least developed country status by 2022 . Nepal also has a vast potential to generate hydropower for export .   Nepal 's foreign relations expanded after the Anglo-Nepal Treaty of 1923 , which was recognised by the League of Nations . After a Soviet veto in 1949 , Nepal was admitted to the United Nations in 1955 . Friendship treaties were signed with the Dominion of India in 1950 and the People 's Republic of China in 1960 . Nepal hosts the permanent secretariat of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation ( SAARC ) , of which it is a founding member .

Sicily is located in the central Mediterranean Sea , south of the Italian Peninsula , from which it is separated by the narrow Strait of Messina . Its most prominent landmark is Mount Etna , the tallest active volcano in Europe , and one of the most active in the world , currently 3329 m high . The island has a typical Mediterranean climate .   The earliest archaeological evidence of human activity on the island dates from as early as 12,000 BC . By around 750 BC , Sicily had three Phoenician and a dozen Greek colonies and , for the next 600 years , it was the site of the Sicilian Wars and the Punic Wars . Sicily frequently remained Independent while the rest of Italy frequently changed hands after the fall of the Roman Empire in the 5th century AD . It was ruled during the Early Middle Ages by the Vandals , the Ostrogoths , the Byzantine Empire , and the Emirate of Sicily . The Norman conquest of southern Italy led to the creation of the Kingdom of Sicily , which was subsequently ruled by the Hohenstaufen , the Capetian House of Anjou , Spain , the House of Habsburg , It was finally unified under the House of Bourbon with the Kingdom of Naples as the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies . It became part of Italy in 1860 following the Expedition of the Thousand , a revolt led by Giuseppe Garibaldi during the Italian unification , and a plebiscite . Sicily was given special status as an autonomous region after the Italian constitutional referendum of 1946 .   Sicily has a rich and unique culture , especially with regard to the arts , music , literature , cuisine , and architecture .

It contains the geographic South Pole and is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere , almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle , and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean . At 14000000 km2 , it is the fifth-largest continent . For comparison , Antarctica is nearly twice the size of Australia . About 98 % of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages 1.9 km in thickness , which extends to all but the northernmost reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula .   Antarctica , on average , is the coldest , driest , and windiest continent , and has the highest average elevation of all the continents . Antarctica is a desert , with annual precipitation of only 200 mm ( 8 in ) along the coast and far less inland . The temperature in Antarctica has reached \u2212 89.2 \u00b0 C ( \u2212 128.6 \u00b0 F ) , though the average for the third quarter ( the coldest part of the year ) is \u2212 63 \u00b0 C ( \u2212 81 \u00b0 F ) . Anywhere from 1,000 to 5,000 people reside throughout the year at the research stations scattered across the continent . Organisms native to Antarctica include many types of algae , bacteria , fungi , plants , protista , and certain animals , such as mites , nematodes , penguins , seals and tardigrades . Vegetation , where it occurs , is tundra .   Although myths and speculation about a Terra Australis ( `` Southern Land '' ) date back to antiquity , Antarctica is noted as the last region on Earth in recorded history to be discovered and colonised by humans , being only first sighted in 1820 by the Russian expedition of Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev on Vostok and Mirny , who sighted the Fimbul ice shelf . The continent , however , remained largely neglected for the rest of the 19th century because of its hostile environment , lack of easily accessible resources , and isolation . In 1895 , the first confirmed landing was conducted by a team of Norwegians .   Antarctica is a de facto condominium , governed by parties to the Antarctic Treaty System that have consulting status . Twelve countries signed the Antarctic Treaty in 1959 , and thirty-eight have signed it since then . The treaty prohibits military activities and mineral mining , prohibits nuclear explosions and nuclear waste disposal , supports scientific research , and protects the continent 's ecozone .

Often considered the best player in the world and regarded by many as the greatest of all time , Messi is the only player in history to win five FIFA Ballon d'Or awards , four of which he won consecutively , and the first to win three European Golden Shoes . He has won 29 trophies with Barcelona , including eight La Liga titles , four UEFA Champions League titles , and five Copas del Rey . Both a prolific goalscorer and a creative playmaker , Messi holds the records for most official goals scored in La Liga ( 349 ) , a La Liga season ( 50 ) and a club football season in Europe ( 73 ) , as well as those for most assists made in La Liga ( 137 ) and the Copa Am\u00e9rica ( 11 ) . He has scored over 500 senior career goals for club and country .   Born and raised in central Argentina , Messi was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency as a child . At age 13 , he relocated to Spain to join Barcelona , who agreed to pay for his medical treatment . After a fast progression through Barcelona 's youth academy , Messi made his competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004 . Despite being injury-prone during his early career , he established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years , finishing 2007 as a finalist for both the Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year award , a feat he repeated the following year . His first uninterrupted campaign came in the 2008 -- 09 season , during which he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football . At 22 years old , Messi won the Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year award by record voting margins .   Three successful seasons followed , with Messi winning three consecutive FIFA Ballons d'Or , including an unprecedented fourth . His personal best campaign to date was the 2011 -- 12 season , in which he set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a single season , while establishing himself as Barcelona 's all-time top scorer in official competitions in March 2012 . He again struggled with injury during the following two seasons , twice finishing second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo , his perceived career rival . Messi regained his best form during the 2014 -- 15 campaign , breaking the all-time goalscoring records in both La Liga and the Champions League in November 2014 , and led Barcelona to a historic second treble .   An Argentine international , Messi is his country 's all-time leading goalscorer . At youth level , he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship , finishing the tournament with both the Golden Ball and Golden Shoe , and an Olympic gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics . His style of play as a diminutive , left-footed dribbler drew comparisons with compatriot Diego Maradona , who declared the teenager his successor . After making his senior debut in August 2005 , Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a FIFA World Cup during the 2006 edition , and reached the final of the 2007 Copa Am\u00e9rica , where he was named young player of the tournament . As the squad 's captain from August 2011 , he led Argentina to three consecutive finals : the 2014 World Cup , for which he won the Golden Ball , and the 2015 and 2016 Copas Am\u00e9rica .", "metadata": {}}

{"pid": "Huntington's_disease", "title_text": "Huntington's disease", "passage_text": "Huntington 's disease ( HD ) , also known as Huntington 's chorea , is an inherited disorder that results in death of brain cells . The earliest symptoms are often subtle problems with mood or mental abilities . A general lack of coordination and an unsteady gait often follow . As the disease advances , uncoordinated , jerky body movements become more apparent . Physical abilities gradually worsen until coordinated movement becomes difficult and the person is unable to talk . Mental abilities generally decline into dementia . The specific symptoms vary somewhat between people . Symptoms usually begin between 30 and 50 years of age , but can start at any age . The disease may develop earlier in life in each successive generation . About 8 % of cases start before the age of 20 years and typically present with symptoms more similar to Parkinson 's disease . People with HD often underestimate the degree of their problems .   HD is typically inherited from a person 's parents , with 10 % of cases due to a new mutation . The disease is caused by an autosomal dominant mutation in either of an individual 's two copies of a gene called Huntingtin . This means a child of an affected person typically has a 50 % chance of inheriting the disease . The Huntingtin gene provides the genetic information for a protein that is also called `` huntingtin '' . Expansion of CAG ( cytosine-adenine-guanine ) triplet repeats in the gene coding for the Huntingtin protein results in an abnormal protein , which gradually damages cells in the brain , through mechanisms that are not fully understood . Diagnosis is by genetic testing , which can be carried out at any time , regardless of whether or not symptoms are present . This fact raises several ethical debates : the age at which an individual is considered mature enough to choose testing ; whether parents have the right to have their children tested ; and managing confidentiality and disclosure of test results .   There is no cure for HD . Full-time care is required in the later stages of the disease . Treatments can relieve some symptoms and in some improve quality of life . The best evidence for treatment of the movement problems is with tetrabenazine . HD affects about 4 to 15 in 100,000 people of European descent . It is rare among Japanese , while the occurrence rate in Africa is unknown . The disease affects men and women equally . Complications such as pneumonia , heart disease , and physical injury from falls reduce life expectancy . Suicide is the cause of death in about 9 % of cases . Death typically occurs fifteen to twenty years from when the disease was first detected .   The first likely description of the disease was in 1841 by Charles Oscar Waters . The condition was described in further detail in 1872 by George Huntington , after whom it is named . The genetic basis was discovered in 1993 by an international collaborative effort led by the Hereditary Disease Foundation . Research and support organizations began forming in the late 1960s to increase public awareness , to provide support for individuals and their families , and to promote research . Current research directions include determining the exact mechanism of the disease , improving animal models to aid with research , testing of medications to treat symptoms or slow the progression of the disease , and studying procedures such as stem cell therapy with the goal of repairing damage caused by the disease .", "metadata": {}}

{"pid": "Shingles", "title_text": "Shingles", "passage_text": "Shingles , also known as herpes zoster , is a viral disease characterized by a painful skin rash with blisters in a localized area . Typically the rash occurs in a single stripe either on the left or right of the body or face . Two to four days before the rash occurs there may be tingling or local pain in the area . Otherwise there are typically few symptoms . The rash usually heals within two to four weeks ; however , some people develop ongoing nerve pain which can last for months or years , a condition called postherpetic neuralgia . In those with poor immune function the rash may occur widely . If the rash involves the eye , vision loss may occur .   Shingles is due to a reactivation of varicella zoster virus ( VZV ) within a person 's body . Chickenpox is due to an initial infection with VZV . Once chickenpox has resolved , the virus may remain inactive in nerve cells . When it reactivates it travels from the nerve body to the endings in the skin producing blisters . Risk factors for reactivation include old age , poor immune function , and having had chickenpox before 18 months of age . How the virus remains in the body or subsequently re-activates is not well understood . Exposure to the virus in the blisters can cause chickenpox in someone who has not had it before but will not trigger shingles . Diagnosis is typically based on a person 's signs and symptoms . Varicella zoster virus is not the same as herpes simplex virus ; however , they belong to the same family of viruses .   The shingles vaccine decreases the chance of shingles by about half in those between the ages of 50 and 80 . It also decreases rates of postherpetic neuralgia , and if an outbreak occurs , its severity . After 80 the vaccine is still effective , just less so . It contains the same material as the varicella vaccine , just at a higher dose . If shingles develops , antiviral medications such as aciclovir can reduce the severity and duration of disease if started within 72 hours of the appearance of the rash . Evidence does not show a significant effect of antivirals or steroids on rates of postherpetic neuralgia . Paracetamol , NSAIDs , or opioids may be used to help with the acute pain .   It is estimated that about a third of people develop shingles at some point in their life . While more common among older people , children may also get the disease . The number of new cases per year ranges from 1.2 -- 3.4 per 1,000 among healthy individuals to 3.9 -- 11.8 per 1,000 among those older than 65 years of age . About half of those living to age 85 will have at least one attack , and less than 5 % will have more than one attack . The disease has been recognized since ancient times .", "metadata": {}}

As dictator of the German Reich , he initiated World War II in Europe with the invasion of Poland in September 1939 , and was central to the Holocaust .   Hitler was born in Austria , then part of Austria-Hungary , and raised near Linz . He moved to Germany in 1913 and was decorated during his service in the German Army in World War I . He joined the German Workers ' Party ( DAP ) , the precursor of the NSDAP , in 1919 and became leader of the NSDAP in 1921 . In 1923 he attempted a coup in Munich to seize power . The failed coup resulted in Hitler 's imprisonment , during which he dictated the first volume of his autobiography and political manifesto Mein Kampf ( `` My Struggle '' ) . After his release in 1924 , Hitler gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles and promoting Pan-Germanism , anti-semitism , and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda . Hitler frequently denounced international capitalism and communism as being part of a Jewish conspiracy .   By 1933 , the Nazi Party was the largest elected party in the German Reichstag , which led to Hitler 's appointment as Chancellor on 30 January 1933 . Following fresh elections won by his coalition , the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act , which began the process of transforming the Weimar Republic into Nazi Germany , a one-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of National Socialism . Hitler aimed to eliminate Jews from Germany and establish a New Order to counter what he saw as the injustice of the post-World War I international order dominated by Britain and France . His first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the Great Depression , the effective abandonment of restrictions imposed on Germany after World War I , and the annexation of territories that were home to millions of ethnic Germans -- actions which gave him significant popular support .   Hitler sought Lebensraum ( `` living space '' ) for the German people in Eastern Europe . His aggressive foreign policy is considered to be the primary cause of the outbreak of World War II in Europe . He directed large-scale rearmament and on 1 September 1939 invaded Poland , resulting in British and French declarations of war on Germany . In June 1941 , Hitler ordered an invasion of the Soviet Union . By the end of 1941 German forces and the European Axis powers occupied most of Europe and North Africa . Failure to defeat the Soviets and the entry of the United States into the war forced Germany onto the defensive and it suffered a series of escalating defeats . In the final days of the war , during the Battle of Berlin in 1945 , Hitler married his long-time lover , Eva Braun . On 30 April 1945 , less than two days later , the two killed themselves to avoid capture by the Red Army , and their corpses were burned .   Under Hitler 's leadership and racially motivated ideology , the Nazi regime was responsible for the genocide of at least 5.5 million Jews and millions of other victims whom he and his followers deemed Untermenschen ( `` sub-humans '' ) and socially undesirable . Hitler and the Nazi regime were also responsible for the killing of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and prisoners of war . In addition , 29 million soldiers and civilians died as a result of military action in the European Theatre of World War II . The number of civilians killed during the Second World War was unprecedented in warfare , and constitutes the deadliest conflict in human history .", "metadata": {}}

The Lakers compete in the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) , as a member of the league 's Western Conference Pacific Division . The Lakers play their home games at Staples Center , an arena shared with the NBA 's Los Angeles Clippers , the Los Angeles Sparks of the Women 's National Basketball Association , and the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League . The Lakers are one of the most successful teams in the history of the NBA , and have won 16 NBA championships , their last being in 2010 . As of 2015 , the Lakers are the second most valuable franchise in the NBA according to Forbes , having an estimated value of $ 2.7 billion .   The franchise began with the 1947 purchase of a disbanded team , the Detroit Gems of the National Basketball League ( NBL ) . The new team began playing in Minneapolis , calling themselves the Minneapolis Lakers in honor of the state 's nickname , `` Land of 10,000 Lakes '' . Initially a member of the NBL , the Lakers won the 1948 NBL championship before joining the rival Basketball Association of America and winning five of the next six BAA and NBA championships in Minneapolis after the NBA formed in 1949 . The team was propelled by center George Mikan , who is described by the NBA 's official website as the league 's `` first superstar '' . After struggling financially in the late 1950s following Mikan 's retirement , they relocated to Los Angeles before the 1960 -- 61 season .   Led by Hall of Famers Elgin Baylor and Jerry West , Los Angeles made the NBA Finals six times in the 1960s , but lost each series to the Boston Celtics , beginning their long and storied rivalry . In 1968 , the Lakers acquired four-time NBA Most Valuable Player ( MVP ) Wilt Chamberlain to play center , and after losing in the Finals in 1969 and 1970 , they won their sixth NBA title -- and first in Los Angeles -- in 1972 , led by new head coach Bill Sharman . After the retirement of West and Chamberlain , the team acquired another center , Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , who had won multiple MVP awards , but was unable to make the Finals in the late 1970s . The 1980s Lakers were nicknamed `` Showtime '' due to their Magic Johnson-led fast break-offense , and won five championships in a 9-year span , including their first ever Finals championship against the Celtics in 1985 . This team featured Hall of Famers in Johnson , Abdul-Jabbar , and James Worthy , and a Hall of Fame coach , Pat Riley . After Abdul-Jabbar and Johnson 's retirement , the team struggled in the early 1990s before acquiring Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant in 1996 . Led by O'Neal , Bryant , and another Hall of Fame coach , Phil Jackson , Los Angeles won three consecutive titles between 2000 to 2002 , securing the franchise its second `` three-peat '' . After losing both the 2004 and 2008 NBA Finals , the Lakers won two more championships by defeating the Orlando Magic in 2009 and Boston in 2010 .   The Lakers hold the record for NBA 's longest winning streak , 33 straight games , set during the 1971 -- 72 season . 21 Hall of Famers have played for Los Angeles , while four have coached the team . Four Lakers -- Abdul-Jabbar , Johnson , O'Neal , and Bryant -- have won the NBA MVP Award for a total of eight awards .", "metadata": {}}

{"pid": "Olympic_Games", "title_text": "Olympic Games", "passage_text": "The modern Olympic Games or Olympics ( Jeux olympiques ) are leading international sporting events featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions . The Olympic Games are considered the world 's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating . The Olympic Games are held every four years , with the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart .   Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games , which were held in Olympia , Greece , from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD . Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) in 1894 , leading to the first modern Games in Athens in 1896 . The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement , with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority .   The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games . Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for ice and winter sports , the Paralympic Games for athletes with a disability , and the Youth Olympic Games for teenage athletes . The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic , political , and technological advancements . As a result , the Olympics has shifted away from pure amateurism , as envisioned by Coubertin , to allowing participation of professional athletes . The growing importance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialisation of the Games . World wars led to the cancellation of the 1916 , 1940 , and 1944 Games . Large boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Games .   The Olympic Movement consists of international sports federations ( IFs ) , National Olympic Committees ( NOCs ) , and organising committees for each specific Olympic Games . As the decision-making body , the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each Games , and organises and funds the Games according to the Olympic Charter . The IOC also determines the Olympic programme , consisting of the sports to be contested at the Games . There are several Olympic rituals and symbols , such as the Olympic flag and torch , as well as the opening and closing ceremonies . Over 13,000 athletes compete at the Summer and Winter Olympic Games in 33 different sports and nearly 400 events . The first , second , and third-place finishers in each event receive Olympic medals : gold , silver , and bronze , respectively .   The Games have grown so much that nearly every nation is now represented . This growth has created numerous challenges and controversies , including boycotts , doping , bribery , and a terrorist attack in 1972 . Every two years the Olympics and its media exposure provide unknown athletes with the chance to attain national and sometimes international fame . The Games also constitute an opportunity for the host city and country to showcase themselves to the world .", "metadata": {}}

A website nominally associated with the group describes it as `` an Internet gathering '' with `` a very loose and decentralized command structure that operates on ideas rather than directives '' . The group became known for a series of well-publicized publicity stunts and distributed denial-of-service ( DDoS ) attacks on government , religious , and corporate websites .   Anonymous originated in 2003 on the imageboard 4chan , representing the concept of many online and offline community users simultaneously existing as an anarchic , digitized global brain . Anonymous members ( known as `` Anons '' ) can be distinguished in public by the wearing of Guy Fawkes masks in the style portrayed in the graphic novel and film V for Vendetta .   In its early form , the concept was adopted by a decentralized online community acting anonymously in a coordinated manner , usually toward a loosely self-agreed goal , and primarily focused on entertainment , or `` lulz '' . Beginning with 2008 's Project Chanology -- a series of protests , pranks , and hacks targeting the Church of Scientology -- the Anonymous collective became increasingly associated with collaborative hacktivism on a number of issues internationally . Individuals claiming to align themselves with Anonymous undertook protests and other actions ( including direct action ) in retaliation against copyright-focused campaigns by motion picture and recording industry trade associations . Later targets of Anonymous hacktivism included government agencies of the U.S. , Israel , Tunisia , Uganda , and others ; the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ; child pornography sites ; copyright protection agencies ; the Westboro Baptist Church ; and corporations such as PayPal , MasterCard , Visa , and Sony . Anons have publicly supported WikiLeaks and the Occupy movement . Related groups LulzSec and Operation AntiSec carried out cyberattacks on U.S. government agencies , media , video game companies , military contractors , military personnel , and police officers , resulting in the attention of law enforcement to the groups ' activities . Some actions by members of the group have been described as being anti-Zionist . It has threatened to cyber-attack Israel and engaged in the '' #OpIsrael '' cyber-attacks of Israeli websites on Yom HaShoah ( Holocaust Remembrance Day ) in 2013 .   Dozens of people have been arrested for involvement in Anonymous cyberattacks , in countries including the U.S. , UK , Australia , the Netherlands , Spain , India and Turkey . Evaluations of the group 's actions and effectiveness vary widely .

In use since the 1990s , the term is an adaptation of the initialism LGB , which was used to replace the term gay in reference to the LGBT community beginning in the mid-to-late 1980s . Activists believed that the term gay community did not accurately represent all those to whom it referred .   The initialism has become mainstream as a self-designation ; it has been adopted by the majority of sexuality and gender identity-based community centers and media in the United States , as well as some other English-speaking countries . The term is used also in some other countries , particularly those which languages use the initialism , such as Argentina , France , and Turkey .   The initialism , LGBT , is intended to emphasize a diversity of sexuality and gender identity-based cultures . It may be used to refer to anyone who is non-heterosexual or non-cisgender , instead of exclusively to people who are lesbian , gay , bisexual , or transgender . To recognize this inclusion , a popular variant adds the letter Q for those who identify as queer or are questioning their sexual identity ; LGBTQ has been recorded since 1996 . Those who add intersex people to LGBT groups or organizing use an extended initialism LGBTI . Some people combine the two acronyms and use the term LGBTIQ .
