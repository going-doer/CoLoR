After the television ban, most cigarette advertising took place in magazines, newspapers, and on billboards. However, in 1999 all cigarette billboard advertisements were replaced with anti-smoking messages, with some of these anti-smoking messages playing parodies of cigarette companies advertising figures and slogans. Since 1984, cigarette companies have also been forced to place Surgeon's General warnings on all cigarette packs and advertisements because of the passing of the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act.[8] Restrictions on cigarette companies became even tighter in 2010 with the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. The act prohibits tobacco companies from sponsoring sports, music, and other cultural events and also prevents the display of their logos or products on T-shirts, hats, or other apparel.[9] The constitutionality of both this act and the Food and Drug Administration's new graphic cigarette warning labels are being questioned under cigarette companies' first amendment rights.[10]", "metadata": {}, "summary_text": "After World War II, cigarette companies utilized television for advertising until the Federal Communications Commission mandated anti-smoking ads at no cost.

For the most part Mali is covered, with the rest just having areas of the ancient empire cross into their borders. After a series of unsuccessful successions and exchanges of power and changes of ruler, the Empire of Mali was weakened greatly. As a result of these issues a civil war erupted upon the Kingdom which further incapacitated old Mali. Because of the war going on, trade was disrupted. Trade was a huge reason that the empire was thriving economically, and so its disruption led to a direct collapse of the empire entirely. For the sake of convenience, the modern day Mali will be explored instead of including every single area where the empire stretched, since it remained primarily in this region and hence had the most influence on it. Mali is one of the biggest countries in Africa, landlocked in West Africa. It still holds the major trade hub city of Timbuktu, but some of its previous greatness had faded with time and conflicts. The country obtained independence from France in 1960 but continued to face many other hardships, including almost a quarter century of dictatorship, before gaining the right to vote in the democratic election of 1992. Since then, there was been many incidents that do not paint this country as a descendant of the once great and powerful empire. The people have suffered through drought and starvation, as well as the very present risk of terrorism and jihadist attacks. In more recent years, the government of Mali struggled with nationalist rebels known as the Tuareg. French soldiers were then brought in to Mali in order to capture towns that were held by rebels. With their help, the Malian government was able to regain control of northern Mali in 2013, which is the same year Ibrahim Boubacar Keita was democratically voted and sworn in as President. There does, however, continue to be conflict to this day. As recent as January of 2018, some 14 soldiers and almost 30 civilians are killed at the hands of an ongoing battle. Current day Mali is certainly not a model of what Ibn Battuta experienced upon visiting its great Kingdom.

In contrast with the idea of a physiological or reflex response, an operant is a class of structurally distinct but functionally equivalent responses. For example, while a rat might press a lever with its left paw or its right paw or its tail, all of these responses operate on the world in the same way and have a common consequence.

What was important for a behaviorist's analysis of human behavior was not language acquisition so much as the interaction between language and overt behavior. In an essay republished in his 1969 book Contingencies of Reinforcement,[28] Skinner took the view that humans could construct linguistic stimuli that would then acquire control over their behavior in the same way that external stimuli could. The possibility of such \"instructional control\" over behavior meant that contingencies of reinforcement would not always produce the same effects on human behavior as they reliably do in other animals. The focus of a radical behaviorist analysis of human behavior therefore shifted to an attempt to understand the interaction between instructional control and contingency control, and also to understand the behavioral processes that determine what instructions are constructed and what control they acquire over behavior. Recently, a new line of behavioral research on language was started under the name of relational frame theory.", "metadata": {}, "summary_text": "Skinner asserted that Chomsky misunderstood his theories, leading to ongoing debates between their differing views on language acquisition.

For behaviorists like Skinner, the emphasis was more on the interaction between language and observable behavior rather than solely on language acquisition. In his work, Skinner suggested that humans can create linguistic stimuli that influence their behavior akin to external stimuli, indicating a unique \"instructional control\" over behavior. This perspective prompted a shift in research focus towards understanding the interplay between instructional control and reinforcement contingencies, leading to the development of relational frame theory in the study of language."}

In simple conditioning, the dog was presented with a stimulus such as a light or a sound, and then food was placed in the dog's mouth. After a few repetitions of this sequence, the light or sound by itself caused the dog to salivate.[31] Although Pavlov proposed some tentative physiological processes that might be involved in classical conditioning, these have not been confirmed.[citation needed] The idea of classical conditioning helped behaviorist John Watson discover the key mechanism behind how humans acquire the behaviors that they do, which was to find a natural reflex that produces the response being considered.", "metadata": {}, "summary_text": "Classical conditioning, alongside operant conditioning, is a key behavior-analytic process that does not require reference to mental processes.

Huxley recognized that unlike the earlier transmutational ideas of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, Darwin's theory provided a mechanism for evolution without supernatural involvement, even if Huxley himself was not completely convinced that natural selection was the key evolutionary mechanism. Huxley would make advocacy of evolution a cornerstone of the program of the X Club to reform and professionalise science by displacing natural theology with naturalism and to end the domination of British natural science by the clergy. By the early 1870s in English-speaking countries, thanks partly to these efforts, evolution had become the mainstream scientific explanation for the origin of species.[90] In his campaign for public and scientific acceptance of Darwin's theory, Huxley made extensive use of new evidence for evolution from paleontology. This included evidence that birds had evolved from reptiles, including the discovery of Archaeopteryx in Europe, and a number of fossils of primitive birds with teeth found in North America. Another important line of evidence was the finding of fossils that helped trace the evolution of the horse from its small five-toed ancestors.[91] However, acceptance of evolution among scientists in non-English speaking nations such as France, and the countries of southern Europe and Latin America was slower. An exception to this was Germany, where both August Weismann and Ernst Haeckel championed this idea: Haeckel used evolution to challenge the established tradition of metaphysical idealism in German biology, much as Huxley used it to challenge natural theology in Britain.[92] Haeckel and other German scientists would take the lead in launching an ambitious programme to reconstruct the evolutionary history of life based on morphology and embryology.[93]", "metadata": {}, "summary_text": "Thomas Henry Huxley was a pivotal figure in promoting Darwin's theory of evolution, recognizing its mechanism for evolution without supernatural elements, in contrast to earlier ideas by Lamarck.

By the early 1870s, evolution had gained acceptance as the mainstream explanation for species origin in English-speaking countries, aided by Huxley's use of paleontological evidence, such as the discovery of Archaeopteryx, to illustrate the evolution of birds from reptiles and the horse's development from five-toed ancestors.

He helped to bridge the divide between the foundations of microevolution developed by the population geneticists and the patterns of macroevolution observed by field biologists, with his 1937 book Genetics and the Origin of Species. Dobzhansky examined the genetic diversity of wild populations and showed that, contrary to the assumptions of the population geneticists, these populations had large amounts of genetic diversity, with marked differences between sub-populations. The book also took the highly mathematical work of the population geneticists and put it into a more accessible form. In Britain, E. B. Ford, the pioneer of ecological genetics, continued throughout the 1930s and 1940s to demonstrate the power of selection due to ecological factors including the ability to maintain genetic diversity through genetic polymorphisms such as human blood types.

He advocated enslaving Northern factory workers, for their own benefit. Abraham Lincoln, on the other hand, denounced such Southern insinuations that Northern wage earners were fatally fixed in that condition for life.

Craig added emergency water supplies, reinforced the Mint's basement to act as a air-raid shelter and even accepted employment of women for the first time. For most of the war the mint managed to escape the destruction of the Blitz until December 1940 when three members of staff were killed in an air-raid.

This relationship between dietary fats and insulin resistance is presumed secondary to the relationship between insulin resistance and inflammation, which is partially modulated by dietary fat ratios (Omega-3/6/9) with both omega 3 and 9 thought to be anti-inflammatory, and omega 6 pro-inflammatory (as well as by numerous other dietary components, particularly polyphenols and exercise, with both of these anti-inflammatory). Although both pro- and anti-inflammatory types of fat are biologically necessary, fat dietary ratios in most US diets are skewed towards Omega 6, with subsequent disinhibition of inflammation and potentiation of insulin resistance.[5] But this is contrary to the suggestion of more recent studies, in which polyunsaturated fats are shown as protective against insulin resistance.", "metadata": {}, "summary_text": "Diets high in monounsaturated fats, particularly oleic acid, are associated with a lower incidence of insulin resistance, while those high in polyunsaturated fats (notably arachidonic acid) and saturated fats (like arachidic acid) increase insulin resistance.

The mind refers to an individual's ability to use symbols to create meanings for the world around him. Individuals use language and thought to accomplish this goal. Self refers to an individual's ability to reflect on the way that he/she is perceived by others. Finally, society, according to Mead is where all of these interactions are taking place.

But in order to progress, there needs to be the necessary consequences that come with it, which is caused by a \u201cseries of modifications, independent of the human will, to which all classes of society contributed, and of which kings themselves have often been the first agents and most eager promoters\u201d.[20] The people themselves have the ability to produce a new system.

Each stage arises when existing systems lose their effectiveness, leading to societal complications. Comte argues that re-establishing order requires embracing a new, organic social system rather than trying to revive outdated structures. He illustrates this with the example of kings who, despite their intentions to reorganize their kingdoms, often fail because they do not recognize the necessity for reform to address civilization's progress. True advancement depends on societal modifications, driven by all classes, including the kings themselves, highlighting the potential for the people to create a new system aligned with their current reality."}

This explains the colors of these two metals. At the surface of a metal resonance effects known as surface plasmons can result. They are collective oscillations of the conduction electrons like a ripple in the electronic ocean. However, even if photons have enough energy they usually do not have enough momentum to set the ripple in motion. Therefore, plasmons are hard to excite on a bulk metal. This is why gold and copper still look like lustrous metals albeit with a dash of color. However, in colloidal gold the metallic bonding is confined to a tiny metallic particle, preventing the oscillation wave of the plasmon from 'running away'. The momentum selection rule is therefore broken, and the plasmon resonance causes an extremely intense absorption in the green with a resulting beautiful purple-red color. Such colors are orders of magnitude more intense than ordinary absorptions seen in dyes and the like that involve individual electrons and their energy states.", "metadata": {}, "summary_text": "The limiting frequency for silver is in the far UV region, while for copper and gold, it is closer to the visible spectrum, which explains their distinct colors.

As a result, gold and copper maintain a lustrous appearance with slight coloration.

Starting in the 1880s, the labor unions aggressively promoted restrictions on immigration, especially restrictions on Chinese and other Asians.[96] The basic fear was that large numbers of unskilled, low-paid workers would defeat the union's efforts to raise wages through collective bargaining.[97] Other groups, such as the prohibitionists, opposed immigration because it was the base of strength of the saloon power, and the West generally. Rural Protestants distrusted the urban Catholics and Jews who comprised most of the immigrants after 1890.[98] On the other hand, the rapid growth of the industry called for large numbers of new workers, so large corporations generally opposed immigration restriction. By the early 1920s a consensus had been reached that the total influx of immigration had to be restricted, and a series of laws in the 1920s accomplished that purpose.[99] A handful of eugenics advocates were also involved in immigration restriction.[100] Immigration restriction continued to be a national policy until after World War II.", "metadata": {}, "summary_text": "After 1896, immigration increased, predominantly consisting of unskilled workers from eastern and southern Europe who found employment in various industries.

The tree is so strong that it bears the tight hold of the creeper. The tree is described as being gallant, and possibly brave, as very few trees could survive in the strangle-hold of this creeper. The poet then goes on to describe the life that thrives amidst every facet of the tree. The tree is metaphorical said as a giant due to its huge size, strength and boldness. The Casuarina Tree is covered with creeper which bears red crimson flowers which appear as though the tree is wearing a colorful scarf. Often at night, the garden echoes and it seems to be jubilant and the song (of a nightingale) has no end; it continues till dawn. At dawn when the poet opens her window she is delighted to see the Casuarina Tree. Mostly in winters a gray baboon is seen sitting on the crest of the tree seeing the sunrise with her younger ones leaping and playing in the tree's boughs.

Toru Dutt has brought out the theme of nature as something that shares feeling with humans, that lightens the burden on the heart. The poet continues with a description of how strong the image of the tree is, even when in lands far away. Even in France and Italy (where the poet studied), she can hear the tree's lament. The poet wishes to consecrate the tree's memory and importance for the sake of those who are now dead - and looks ahead to her own death, hoping that the tree be spared obscurity (or that no-one will remember it). She immortalizes the tree through this poem like how Wordsworth sanctified the Yew trees of Borrowdale.
